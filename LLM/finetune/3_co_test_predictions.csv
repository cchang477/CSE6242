[pros: Depending on the store you get pros lol but my store didn’t do much for nothing.
cons: Over working full timers
Cutting part time hours. Ex. You don’t have a cap on hours for part time, you get what you get and sometimes you can get nothing. 
No benefits unless you’re full time.
You’ll most likely be alone with no help in your department.
My store, you won’t last long if you can’t handle people. 
Management issues - favoritism towards workers who don’t work. An rip on the ones who work hard so you’ll never feel like you accomplished much.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Fair pay, not high or low. Functions at the facilities, mainly put on and organized by employees, but the company does add some to it. Can sometimes work from home, but this is largely used to get 12-16 hours a day and weekends out of people.
cons: The running joke at HPI among thousands of employees is, ""The work / life balance is that work is your life now. That's the balance"". Prepare for required overtime, required working on Veterans Day (even if on a Saturday or Sunday), required working every single day straight for 19 days in November including Saturdays and Sundays in many departments (although not all). It's not a one time event, they actually plan to do this every single year. If you do not work overtime, you cannot keep up with workloads as they purposely plan to give more work than employees can do in 40 hours. Required working through vacations! Even on vacation, most positions it's required to check and respond to emails, even do file work for your position. I have never once had a real vacation off and a couple of them turned into regular 12 hour working days that I never even got to see my family except at dinner. Very strong political views. During the election I received more emails from executives about how evil and awful one side was than I did about HPI. It was depressing that I had to be bombarded at work constantly.] =",neutral,bad,bad

[pros: Staff is always willing to help each other out and the relationships you develop with your surroundings. Strong loyalties are present between teams.
cons: Favoritism by higher up is obvious and leaves other staff in the back burner. Office environment has since gone downhill and do not foresee any improvements under such unprofessional operation. Both the office and HR department lack structure and transparency. There are constant roadblocks in one’s professional growth. Increasing responsibilities and new skills learned do not translate monetarily. Turnover rates are high to make room for unqualified hires via internal relationship.

[pros: - Depending on which market you work in, the pay can be decent for a retail job, but not necessarily adequate for the number of responsibilities you have.  
- Plenty of opportunities to move up quickly (partially due to high turnover)
- Very good family culture--associates treat you as part of a bigger team/family.
cons: - Turnover is extremely high
- If you don't actively seek out training, don't expect to get any 
- Too much bureaucracy.  Upper management doesn't realize how many responsibilities we have on the front lines, so they require time consuming computer training which doesn't help at all.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

[pros: I love working with all my coworkers and the people in the store. There's great gear and a lot of stuff to be learned from each other. You get to sell great gear to interesting people 1 on 1. (Ideally)
cons: The issue is just how much they focus on the rewards program. They are currently demanding 80% they even thought of termination if otherwise but decided it was too harsh.  The pay is low and raises are rare. Hard work is barely noticed. I'm stuck making minimum wage at a place I love, and I can't stand that my work is unnoticed. Generally job satisfaction is dropping by the day and they need to take a look. My store for example lost 3 managers, 1 asst. Manager, 5 guides and 3 floor sups over the past year.

[pros: This job has good benefits, teaches you a lot about personal finance, and has relatively good time off / vacation policies.  In this role you can do a little bit of everything:  

Open accounts (checking, savings, business, estates, trusts, safe deposit boxes, etc), talk about overdrafts, take applications (credit card, personal loans, auto, home equities, mortgage, etc.), notary services, power of attorney, process death certificates, hold account reviews, do maintenance to accounts of walk-in customers, make calls to set appointments...the list goes on.
cons: PNC doesn't always pay a lot.  Few branch employees earn sizable bonuses For example, I am one of the top sales people in my region and I have been with the company for 3 years, but I have yet to gross over $35,000 annual income.  

After being at the job for a while you might not see yourself becoming a branch manager or business banker.  If you're like me you'll think retail banking is a good foundation, but you don't see yourself in retail banking dealing with the same types of customer issues day in and day out for the rest of your career.  It's true that in the pros I listed an array of different tasks that you'll be doing on the job, but after a while you will have essentially mastered the tasks you will be doing (for the most part) on a daily basis. The pro was that you learn a lot.  The con is after awhile you don't feel very intellectually challenged (for the most part)...and you feel like you could be making more money.] =",good,neutral,good

[pros: There are many pro's to starting out or even transitioning over into a franchise like Hand and Stone. 

Clients are provided for you. There is no leg work or pavement pounding for clientele.
Your schedule can be flexible to fit your needs.
The staff and fellow employee's are always here to help you out or to offer up professional advice.
You get a bi-weekly pay check that includes $5.00 new member commissions. (not offered elsewhere)
Discounted CEU courses and First Aid re-certification classes.
Health insurance
Pay is based on a 3 tier level commission based design.
cons: There can be many things in which someone could state or list as a ""con"" to them. You have to understand that most MT's choose a franchise as a temporary situation so as to build their skills before venturing onto something else.
You're going to be booked back to back appointments, which can be tedious and stressful at times. (it's still worth it)
There will always be gossip regarding something you did or didn't do. (it's much like a salon in that regard)

Main thing here to think about it is this; You come in, perform your massages and you go home. If you don't involve yourself in the day to day stresses, then working here is a piece of cake. If you like to talk and engage your fellow MT's, then expect not to mesh well with some. It's that simple.] =",excellent,good,good

[pros: I got an $8.75 food credit if I work 4.5 hours to spend towards food. I feel like the food credit shouldn't matter based on the hours of your shift but whether you worked a shift or not. They go hard on training, especially on customer service which is nice because you learn to be professional. Great free food ;)
cons: Can be draining once you work there longer. It can get insanely busy and the line usually never stops because it's chick-fil-a. They do not pay holiday bonuses. The pay isn't as good. I got paid 12.50 per hour but the minimum wage increased so I got 13.50 later on. Chick-fil-a does not offer great benefits to their workers but only towards mostly operators (sometimes managers).

If you get to specific vertical, you will be entitled for Bonus. Some projects are there through igate and has long term relationship with people. So if you are not one of them, you will be sidelined.

[pros: - The atmosphere is great with the recent investments from PayPal and Citi Ventures and with the recent acquisition of a company in LATAM. 
- Some really smart people, so every day is a school day. 
- The working culture is very collaborative and open - people are free to share their views which can be a shock at first (if you are used to working in very corporate environments) but is very refreshing 
- Good focus on employee development with leadership programs and personal development focus
It is a really exciting time at PPRO, not looking to go anywhere any time soon!
cons: - In the last 6 months there has been a lot of change in the business with the separating of the company into two distinct business units - I can understand some of the negative reviews on here from people in the Issuing side - but I am involved in Acquiring / Payments side. Our experience is only positive from this split.
Some other niggles:
- PPRO has hired a brand new C-Suite (CFO, COO, CTO) in the last 6 months - it will take a few more months for these people to bed in - feels a little disjointed at the moment 
- The growth of the customer base exceeds the growth of most departments to cope with the requests for new products/services - so this can be frustrating but think this is the same in most ramping companies] =",excellent,excellent,good

Huge egos at the mid tier level of management to the very top (which is where this toxic culture trickles down from I believe, the very top). Calling on new business I've seen some unsavory gray area tactics to the point where some really good prospects abruptly ended all negotiations. This was common.

[pros: Work/Life balance, Pay and benefits are exceptional.  You have the opportunity to work with people from all over the world and be part of an organization that truly has a global impact.  It's a stable organization and a wonderful place to have a career.
cons: The trade for all of the pros is the difficulty in moving up in the organization once you're in.  With such significant benefits, turnover tends to be rather low and especially in a finance role, there aren't too many positions to move to if you'd like to expand your horizons. Additionally, because of the low turnover, promotions and opportunities for supervisory experience don't come around frequently.  If you're a person looking to move up in your career, this may not be the right role.] =",bad,good,excellent

[pros: If you want to understand the challenges of change in a corporate environment, Deluxe is a great place to learn. Change is difficult . . . especially when you are changing the fundamental business model. So it's a valuable skill to learn. There are some great people . . .
cons: Leadership is not committed to growth, only to survival. They have done the minimum necessary to please Wall Street and get the stock higher. The overall strategy made sense: leverage the customer base of 4MM small biz owners who purchase paper checks from Deluxe. Cross sell them to other relevant (marketing services) offerings that Deluxe established through acquisitions. Deluxe made the acquisitions but failed to make the investments in technology that would link the customer data bases, consolidating the customer data and giving customers a reason to choose the Deluxe brand. The acquisitions they make are small, second or third-tier; never companies with a  breakthrough technology or strong competitive advantage.] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: Co-workers - I would never have stayed so long without great teammates and management up to the VP level.  Decent pay for the area, but not compared to other locations.  Depending on the department, flexible schedules were possible.  Generally family friendly except for overtime.
cons: Top management makes arbitrary decisions that have seriously hurt the company, both in the short and long term.  Our department worked crazy overtime for multiple years in an effort to modernize the product and process and to keep up with our competitors.  It felt like management wanted it (and the company) to fail.

Other reviews referring to layoffs and firings are very accurate.  The company integrity policy (that we were constantly reminded of) felt amazingly hypocritical.

It was very difficult to get promotions for newer hires (hurting retention) and recruiting was already hard.  Everything from facilities to IT seemed stacked against getting things done.  Employee benefits had degraded significantly.

I sold my stock.  I am encouraging the best coworkers to leave as soon as possible. I hope the worst of what's happened comes out publicly.

[pros: Location, benefits, workspace, equipment, work-life balance
cons: - Project scope, language and framework was changed right after I started

- Old and crufty codebase with poor documentation, inconsistent code style rules (mix of semicolons and non-semicolons in a js project), inconsistent file structure

- Manager once told me to get back to work after I spent 8 minutes in Slack chat discussing the pros and cons of a few terms related to testing; got told that I should be coding but had been told that I needed to be more collaborative 5 minutes earlier in the conversation. Typical ""read my mind"" sort of criticism from that manager. 

- Manager seemed surprised that I posted a Confluence doc about the vertical whitespace rules that I and 2 team members agreed on. The project was many years old and no one had written down style rules. Manager said ""I thought all languages wanted zero whitespace"". I had no response to this, I was just flabbergasted. This is one of the most WTF statements I've ever heard from a manager. I told a colleague about it (someone with close to 20 years experience) and his response was one word: ""Run"".  For an example of vertical whitespace in a modern js project: see packages/react/src/React.js in the React github repo (not allowed to link it here) 

- Team member told me ""your question was innapropriate"" after I told them that the condescending response I got to a question was innapropriate. When someone tells you you are being inappropriate you don't say ""no, u"", that's rude. This team has issues.] =",good,neutral,good

[pros: Great employer for vocational trainees (I can only speak for the business focused vocational trainings) with a good salary, a lot of moving around within the company to see many different departments, mostly modern facilities (also depending on individual departments) and lots of on-site training and team building. Overall a great 3 years with a lot of support. A completed vocational training exposes you to many different departments and areas of expertise as well as teaches you skills that will highly benefit your employability in any kind of industry.
cons: Despite having been offered a full-time position after vocational training, no real flexibility in career progression (PA is supposed to stay PA) and chances for development highly depending on your individual department and their employee situation/support from your boss and HR department. The same applies to the advertised subsidised evening/weekend Bachelor's degree, with little chances of a higher position or development within a department] =",bad,neutral,excellent

[pros: You meet amazing people working with Levy, and you have the ability to take part in some incredible events that you would maybe never be able to attend as a guest.
cons: Through my experience, there is a lot of desire to grow from within from an employee and employer standpoint; however, the follow-through seems to fall short about every single time. When you apply for positions they encourage you to apply for they seem to let you down claiming a lack of training in a specific area but don't seem too compelled to help you grow in that area and end up hiring externally.] =",excellent,neutral,bad

[pros: Historic accomplishments and great colleagues with whom to work on challenging problems. Inspiring science stories in every nook and cranny.
cons: The fundamentals are grounded in Washington DC -- heavy attention to federal compliance and government accounting rules. This is sharply out of sync with innovation in Silicon Valley.

[pros: PTO and benefits are decent. Some work from home options. Fellow employees are good hard working people. Pay used to be good but don't expect any raises or bonuses. Heard it's better outside of claims
cons: All my coworkers were miserable and stressed to the point of going out on leave. We got henpecked to death over minute data details so corporate can analyze data rather than grade us on the big picture of how we handled the claim. The expectations changed every time the wind blew and it became impossible to keep up with because you are so busy. 

The company seems to have taken a nose dive the last few years in regards to the morale. Raises are small (if at all). We used to get bonuses but now they expect you to work more and more claims and you better not complain. At least other insurance companies offer profit sharing. Travelers used to pay above the competition but not anymore. Staffing is always off and expectations just keep increasing.] =",terrible,bad,bad

[pros: Hours, ability to engage with customers, learn merchandising, payroll management.
cons: I have worked for Rite Aid since high school, starting as a cashier and promoted to shift supervisor. Ideally my roll as a shift consists of babysitting adults and senior citizens, chasing thieving drug addicts who steal, and listening to customers complain that we don't have their adult underwear in stock. Since the introduction of the Plenti card, I have been reamed multiple times, including one that I don't know how to do my job. The location I'm at is 24 hours, which means there is always a possibility you get stuck with a 10pm-6am shift. If you start at 6am(working a 6-2 shift) I am almost always alone for at least an hour. Not only is it dangerous, the only customers encountered are ones who need to buy a pack of smokes. I have worked numerous holidays and weekends, missing family functions, birthdays and even funerals. The corporation doesn't listen to any recommendations, doesn't want to pay their employees enough to live off of, and doesn't consider their safety(with the exception of telling their management to not chase thieves). I have been working towards my bachelors degree in the mean time, but would never consider a career with this corporation.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: Line Managers
Flexibility to switch locations
cons: This review is purely the experience i am having as an ex-employee seeking out assistance from Capgemini HR

Hi, I am an ex-igate (currently capgemini) employee. I was employed with Igate from July 19, 2010 to September 11, 2015. 

I have been trying to withdraw my PF as i no longer reside in India and it serves no purpose for me as it has been more than 8 years since last i worked in India. 

PF withdrawal now requires UAN number. I have tried to generate it online but since my PF account is prior to 2014 , i could not do it myself and EPFO website did not recognize my PF number. 

I reached to Capgemini in January 2020 to assist with UAN generation as it can be done only my employer for older PF accounts.

I have sent may be 30+ emails and provided every bit of information to capgemini officials to generate my UAN. There has been no response for almost 1 year now to generate a simple UAN number which is may be 5minutes work for them.

There has been emails after emails to follow up and capgemini responds once in a month or twice a month but they do not tell me what they need nor they generate UAN number. 

This has been almost borderline harassment as this HR team would not provide what employees need and in turn withholding my PF withdrawal money for over an year. 

I am attaching the email thread and conversation with them. Please note, as the email thread is long and this site only allows jpg files, i am attaching multiple jpg files.

I am now formally raising this complaint and seek resolution. This torture to withhold money is very stressful and i require the money and Capgemini as an ex-employer is not helping.] =",neutral,bad,none

[pros: Salary and benefits are on time (payroll is probably the one dept they haven't screwed up yet), good camaraderie among my coworkers, a few ""good eggs"" that you can learn from.

There is also an overzealous group of people here desperately trying to salvage the Sage brand, as evidenced by their trolling of Glassdoor and lightning-quick response times. Kudos to you.
cons: If you've seen the TV series ""The Office"" and liked it for its comic dysfunction. #lifeatsage is a perverted, morally disturbing version of that and you are one of the unfortunate characters in it. At a high level, the company's priorities and business decisions are driven by one person/a handful of people - which would be awesome if they had the mind of Steve Jobs. This is clearly not the case, as seen in continuously floundering business performance. But let's focus on day-to-day events that will actually impact your sanity and satisfaction (here's a few accdg to a BCG survey):

1. Appreciation for your work - there is none here. NONE. Unless you can change the business overnight or blindly take orders from the dictator/s here, anything positive or useful you deliver is basically ignored. Or worse, your manager (who knows nothing) passes it off and his/her work. There is blatant disregard for your expertise/skills that the company hired you for, which really speeds up employee demotivation.

2. Good relationships with superiors - if this involves anything that remotely resembles what you would expect of a good manager/leadership based on prior corporate experience (purposeful coaching, mutual respect, etc.), you are NOT getting it here. Dictatorship is alive and well here, so the health of your relationship with your manager hinges on your willingness to follow the ruling class - even if it makes no business sense. DON'T be foolish and expect your manager to vouch for you for doing what's right for the business/customer if it goes against the consensus of the ruling circle. 

3. Company's financial stability, job security - Sage is a global company with presence in 20+ countries, so there's that. The Reston business, though, is up for sale and it feels like the mother company is just itching to get rid of it. Let's also not forget the fact that sales are routinely missed. 

4. Learning and career development - Every place presents an opportunity to learn. Here you'll learn a lot here about: launching products that DO NOT work, selling products that don't deliver on customer needs, ignoring what your customers want, following blindly even if all the data/facts tell you otherwise, how to effectively pass blame, the list goes on... Career development is a concept that's completely foreign to Sage. It's pretty normal here for managers NOT take the time to appropriately onboard and integrate their new hires, talk them through the business goals and strategy (oh wait - there's NONE!), clearly articulate deliverables/what you'll be measured against, etc. IF your manager actually has a development conversation with you (yes, that's optional in this place), it's haphazardly done. How your responsibilities evolve has nothing to do with honing your skills, or what you'll learn from it. It's influenced SOLELY by what needs to be done and whether or not you have the bandwidth. 

5. Company Values - This is the only place I've worked for where senior/tenured professionals are routinely chewed up in front 10+ people. What should be reserved for a private coaching conversation is being discussed in a business meeting - complete with a sprinkling of swear words and the company's leadership team condoning it. You'll see VP's and entire teams engaging in a blame game. Remote meeting participants are put on mute so that those in the room can disparage them. The ruling class here is completely tone deaf to the concerns of the worker bees. It's no wonder that they turn a blind eye to the astronomical attrition rate. 

You're probably thinking - wow, a lot of HR issues here, why not report them? Reston HR is a joke: the job is more of being a mole to leadership vs. addressing/escalating employee concerns, implementing checks and balances. My faith in global Sage's HR is dissipating quickly since these concerns have persisted for YEARS.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

cons: No morals or integrity in this company, AT&T is just looking to influx their numbers for its share holders. They do not care about the customers nor it’s employees. They cut back to save some money and put more and more work on the retail sales consultant and it is only going to get worse. Health insurance for part timers is out of control (about $585 a month) and the commission just continues to decline. Direct Management and higher management urges you to sell products that do not fit the customer and push them to buy things they do not need which then makes the customer never want to come back. The decline in sales at AT&T is all due to their lack of morality and greed. Goodbye, so long, as an AT&T employee and as an At&t customer it’s even worse.] =",neutral,terrible,bad

The tools you have to use are sometimes ridiculously unusable.

[pros: The teams are actually very efficient in getting things done across all company. People are very smart, relatively young, very creative & ambitious, which is a good thing to keep clients and meet their expectations. I had a very good time working at Media Assembly - you get things done, you get rewards. And they pay you well. I like their HR department, they are making changes and improvements daily. Moreover, my team members that doing Analytics and data sciences are very smart, where you can learn things every day. The data engineering team provides good trainings to teams across the board. Clients are interesting, the planning team get things done in a very logic and rational way.
cons: Not that I can think of.  However, the company is relatively young and acquired by a bigger company. Tough competitions outside. Need to retain talent.] =",excellent,good,excellent

[pros: You get to learn a lot about technology first hand which is a useful life skill. Shifts are pretty flexible. You get discount on all products too (Except some apple products) which is really useful. The pay isn't that bad if you manage to get your bonuses by hitting targets. It's a typical retail job and I would recommend it to people overall if they want a job and want to learn about technology.
cons: Long working hours, short staff with uneven product training which results in the same colleagues carrying the team. Another con is pretty much the extreme targets and unrealistic expectations from higher ups. Selling extended warranties is always awkward and you can't force a customer to take it but management will constantly bring it up. CSAT is also absolutely ridiculous. CSAT is customer feedback surveys which have a huge impact on your bonus and this can be brought down by 8/10 star ratings which on the outside appears good but in reality it's cost us all hundreds of bonus. It's unethical in my opinion.] =",neutral,good,bad

[pros: IBM still draws some of the best and brightest. The work can be quite interesting and challenging. And the company offers flexibility in terms of work times and locations (unless you're required to be at a client site).
cons: There can be a strong feeling of disconnection. You may work with a team that's widely scattered or based elsewhere, and rarely if ever see them. You spend much of your time on conference calls, often at odd hours if you're dealing with colleagues in other parts of the world. Managers range from good to awful. Unfortunately, I encountered more of the ""awful"" than the good. And finally, career growth can be difficult to impossible. Even if you're a top performer, raises are small to non-existent. The company sets targets that never seem to be reached, at least as far as producing income for employees. The shareholders, on the other hand, almost always hear a much rosier story.] =",bad,bad,excellent

[pros: Allows 4some flexibility/balance 4personal/professional life.

If you need to take a break then Active is it but be prepared to embelish on the resume when you reenter the workforce.  Active can be a place of longevity if you make it to the 5 year mark however getting there could be trying.   If you know how to work the system this is the company for you!
cons: You or the customer will get lost in company's newly implemented process/procedures. Active suffers from ""not my job"" syndrome.  Active is a company that gobbles up other companies and then discards one by one those assets it aquired and be prepared if you are one of those employees because it will happen to you.

[pros: 1. Some teams have a good ‘family feel’ work ethic and there are some genuinely good people.
2. Good internship opportunities with internal mobility widely championed.
3. Good external speaker events and lots of opportunities for self-directed development/networking.
4. Opportunities to learn new parts of the bank outside of day job.
5. Volunteering and charity events widely encouraged. Some good internal campaigns to increase moral during challenging times the bank is under.
6. Defined quarterly performance process although this is relatively standard.
7. Good 30-day holiday allowance with the opportunity to buy 5 more days. Some teams have dress down Friday, giving a sense of work-life balance.
8. Some very proactive initiatives and senior managers widely championing such programmes.
cons: 1. DBOI contracts not as good as AG contracts yet judged to the same standard.
2. Toxic culture, often easy to get shunted into doing mundane work with little direction or in some cases interaction. Can easily bend over backwards and gain little recognition from some seniors. ‘Sink or swim’ culture where there is often more work than resources and questionable as to who is really benefiting from this way of working.
3. Very hierarchical and political. Some take titles and politics way too far over what wider value they’re creating for the teams they’re managing and their surrounding colleagues.
4. Technology and processes are poor compared to other companies within the financial industry.
5. Promotions feel like who you know rather than what you know and often a popularity contest. If you don’t fit in you’ll notice very quickly and in some cases won’t get a lot of support. A lot of sucking up to senior managers goes on and individuals being prepared to stamp on others to get noticed by seniors, such as snitching and blame culture. Local line managers often left to their own devices which means junior employees struggle to progress. Creates a very toxic environment. Certain personalities dominate and often get the final say on everything.
6. Very hard to climb the ranks, especially if you’re junior and in with a manager who is going to take a lot of persuading that you’re worth it.
7. Flexible working is highly promoted but executed poorly, at the discretion of the line manager which makes the policy very unfair. Rigid 40-hour 9am-6pm week for DBOI contracts from a bygone era with little flexibility around this. An expectation to do overtime whenever required and the ability to only claim in lieu with no financial compensation offered. Some teams have strict rules on when holiday can and can't be used.
8. Some HR staff need serious retraining, some come across as cold, not terribly people-centric and very defensive.
9. Some senior management who get into powerful positions risks becoming blind to the everyday struggles that go on in the front line, including people resigning. There is a ‘management stick together’ culture where some local AVP, VP or D managers are too quick to go on the defensive against their own, their favourites or their seniors which means especially if you’re junior, you will struggle to get listened to even if your argument is perfectly reasonable or at least warrants some concern.] =",neutral,terrible,excellent

[pros: - Very talented team with some of the most experienced people in the business. When there's challenging work, there's lots of opportunity to learn from them and grow as an artist.- Reasonably laid back working style. There's not a lot of pressure forcing artists to work unpaid overtime during the weekdays. Weekend work can be necessary during crunch time but the artists are always given the choice of saying no if they have other commitments.

- HR is helpful and understanding if there are personal issues interfering with work.

- Nice facilities including bicycle parking and showers with fresh towels. Very useful for people commuting with bicycle or going to the gym before or after work.

- Better pay compared to other VFX Facilities in London.
cons: - While most of the team consists of friendly people who are great to work with, the occasional toxic personality can really bring the entire morale down. Especially when it's a supervisor who has been complained about to the HR multiple times and the company has chosen not to take any action against. It's very discourging to see decent and talented artists being subjected to abusive and condescending behaviour, not being protected by the employer and leaving the company or refusing to return at a later time, as a result. A company of this size and reputation should protect its employees over a single individual no matter how ""important"" they might be.

- Little to no job security. They are unable to compete with other VFX vendors in London and cannot get decent amount of quality work as a result. And this means lots of people being let go on the regular. Unfortunately ILM has become very unreliable for artists who want to have a stable and reliable income. 

- Bad management of projects causing financial loss on the regular, which in turn means Christmas bonuses are cancelled. It would be hard to complain about this, considering it's just a nice gesture and not promised or guaranteed. But it's incredibly frustrating when you're being bombarded by coorporate Disney about how amazing the company is doing, while artists are not only not being rewarded for their hardwork but are also in risk of losing their jobs. It feels like a slap in the face when the big boss gets a yearly bonus that could pay everyone's salaries for a decade.] =",neutral,bad,excellent

cons: Management on the administrative side of the organization has not yet hit its stride. There is a strong ""get into the weeds"" approach from Director through to Exec VP level that becomes disruptive to progress.

[pros: I like that Internet Brands/CarsDirect is a casual Workplace.  Being able to show up in what's comfortable,rather than a suit just for the sake of wearing a suit allows me the opportunity to focus on the work in front of me.  Plus, in my job I am on the phone with clients, face to face presentations would be another thing entirely.  I also enjoy the flexible hours.  We are given the opportunity to choose our own schedule.  I deal with many clients on the east coast who are 3 hours ahead of me, so working an earlier shift is beneficial in my contacting them.  In addition, it allows me a better work/life balance as I leave work earlier than I would if I worked a typical 9 to 5 schedule.  El Segundo is convenient to many areas in & around LA, thus making is easy to draw employees from many areas.  Plus it puts me in a great position for many errands I may be running after my regular workday.
cons: Communication of new programs & relevant industry information could be better.  Meetings are held sporadically in my department, sometimes at the beginning of the month, sometimes later in the month and sometimes not at all.   Apparently raises are not considered for the first 3 years, I have never heard of this practice before.  I have always been given performance reviews & raises annually at every other place I have worked prior to CarsDirect/Internet Brands.  In addition, the Dealer Relations department does not get medical benefits for the first 6 months of employment, although other departments start benefits at 1 & 3 months.] =",neutral,good,excellent

Great work-life balance. Great support for internal growth.
cons: Incredibly slow paced. Skewed understanding of 'innovation' and 'change'. Be prepared to use lots of outdated, inefficient processes and tools. Little to no direct support with HR or IT (all remote and buried in hard-to-find dashboards). Unclear goals around growth. Design and user experience is a rock-bottom priority.

[pros: You get to work and collaborate with amazing clients and some great co-workers who believe in what they are doing & are loyal, almost to a fault.
cons: • The loyal & committed employees are constantly told they need to prove themselves or show their worth, when management ignores their value and proven statistics. • Senior leadership who actually know what they are doing get replaced with a Skillsoft “Life’er” who destroys a department in less than a year. Who is held accountable when ¾ of a team left in a 12-month period? 1-2 people leaving = it’s an employee issue – ¾ leaving it’s an employer issue. • No one has been replaced so those that remain get rewarded with extra workload from those that left. • Top talent has left because no one would listen or help. Teammates told HR and their managers that they were seeking opportunities after being ignore by new senior leadership, being horribly underpaid, and benefits/perks getting taken away. • You’d join internal product meetings, only for product and senior leaders question who the implementation team is, having no clue who actually implements new clients and does so while developing their own resources & materials to support clients. It’s crazy considering implementation actually contributes profits to the organization. • Teammates get promised promotions just to keep them with the company, but we know these are empty lies. • Salary is heavily under industry standards, and better yet they rebrand/retitle the team to ensure they don’t have to pay more but their workload increases. • Management or those trying to move into management take credit for other people’s work.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: The staff is what keeps this place running. If it wasn't for the staffs big heart and genuine love for the residents this would fall apart. A few people in management care but are bound but the unrealistic expectations of corporate.
cons: Between staff constantly being understaffed and overworked and the residents not getting the care that they deserve due to the staff being understaffed and overworked it makes this job very stressful and overwhelming. Staff is constantly asking for more staff to help and corporate continues to refuse and cut the staffing budget. There are 40+ residents to 3 staff members during the day. There are at least 3 lawsuits against the facility that I worked at for negligence. There are several families that have told me that they were lied to about the community and what would be provided to their elder by not only the sales representative but also the executive director. Maintenance is worked like a dog. The kitchen is understaffed and overlooked. The front desk is always overwhelmed.

The management are quick to blame their subordinates for mistakes or targets not reached. The publishing department is only focused on reaching number targets and don't care how or who they trample on to get there. There is no room for career progression, which is another reason for the extremely high turnover of staff.

[pros: Good central location, very close to Blackfriars so easy to get to, and some of the people working there are nice
cons: GlobalData is a terrible employer, offering little in the way of career progression, support or even enough resources to do your job properly. The fact that there are so many positive reviews makes me strongly suspect many have been written by shills at the instruction of senior management, something that is highly characteristic of their approach to problems at the company. 

The IT is the biggest joke of any company I have ever worked at - there are far too few staff in this department, and the vast majority of the computers are well below the specs they should be for the roles they are being used to support. Much of the software used is also decades old, and often unsuitable.

The vast majority of the teams are also woefully underesourced, with a fraction of the staff needed to do the work at hand properly. Many have no budgets for basic things to support their work, and it is not uncommon for people to end up funding things out of their own pockets simply to do their jobs properly.

There is an unwillingness to spend money on anything, no matter how much of a good business case it is, with employees expected to work miracles and match rivals with budgets ten times the size. 

Communication between the senior management and the rest of the staff is almost non-existent, with changes coming out of the blue, and contradictory decisions being made on a regular basis. Staff with expertise are never consulted on decisions, meaning many of those made are totally unworkable. 

The average pay is well below market rate. Regular pay rises do not exist, and attempts to negotiate pay increases are made near impossible by the fact that non-managerial employees do not have access to anyone with the power to approve them. There is also little in the way of career progression opportunities.

The company also breaks people. There is a fairly abusive culture, with employees often being very aggressive to each other, and refusing to support each other when required. This appears to stem from the attitude of the CEO and trickles down through the company. This combined with the lack of resources results in many people becoming highly stressed and burning out. 

The office is also filthy, and too small for the number of people who work there. 

This is a terrible place to work. Do not work here if you have any other options.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: There is a free gym and some classes like yoga in the office. You also get free snacks and drinks.

Depending on your job, hours can be somewhat flexible. Unlike other gaming companies, there is little to no crunch time here.

It may be a good place for you it you want your first experience in mobile or casual gaming.
cons: Regularly at parties, people are trying to make out with others (whether they are single or not), people don't seem to remember they are at a work event. You may experience unwanted attention from others at the parties.

It's very hard to get fired from here, whether you are incompetent or not. Despite people complaining to HR and managers, laziness is everywhere and nothing is done about this. You may be accused of not being ""fun and friendly"" for talking about this. There is little to no incentive to work hard because you probably won't get a promotion and may only get 1% more pay rise. The highest end of year rating is unobtainable. 

Pay has a huge variation between people in the same job. You may have same job title but find out over time your total compensation is 25% lower than someone else because of when you started King. The bonus ranges are now capped compared to older employees. The company tries to discourage you discussing pay as they don't want you to find out about disparities. Other reviews have mentioned before that last year pay rises were below inflation for most people. 

Attrition has been high for a year, with some people leaving without their annual bonus because they are either being underpaid and getting better offers elsewhere, or just can't take it anymore. Very little has changed even with so many people leaving, despite hours of feedback sessions. 

Games take years to fail and there isn't much accountability for this, the same people get moved onto the next new project. However, others get stuck maintaining live games for years and never get the opportunity to move onto a new project. It's all about knowing the right people in order to get moved, favouritism has been a problem in the studio.] =",terrible,bad,excellent

[pros: If you can withstand the below average pay scale for your education/skill level and accept that poorly educated union clerks/personnel  get paid substantially more than the attorneys, managers, even some assistant directors - then you will be able to enjoy the retirement benefit package.   The active benefits are generous as well.
cons: Programs and business mindset are antiquated.  Old railroad mentality very much present.  Little to no room for advancement unless you “in” with the right group.  Inequitable benefits and pay in comparison to other agencies within the MTA not to mention other employers.  While they will speak on “people first,” this is for the public and their perception.  There is no real concern about employees, they continue to add obligations and responsibilities without any concern for work life balance -ie) STAR program the recently implemented Mandatory volunteer program forcing employees to change their schedules and be placed in remote locations with no security or facilities - no concern for parents with  children and their schedules or what risks their are to employees who are FORCED to get home at all hours of the night.

[pros: Respect and understanding amongst fellow employees in general are noticable.  Projects are tackled with teamwork at times when necessary but very rare.  Teamwork in most groups are very compatible.  Every member of the team finds there talent within each others work space for contribution.  However, most projects are self completed.  Milestones are monitored very professionally by management and reasonable because of our given lack of resources and tools.  Hours are flexible (and needs to be in this environment).  Maintanence and administrative crew are always on top of reliability.  In general, working with the fellow co-workers are enjoyable and still get down to the work.
cons: Big factor is many senior engineers with poor technical knowledge.  Piers with some knowledge have no time to spare for guidance.  Disorganized ongoing projects and tasks in segments of work tasks to never be able to execute or complete properly.  Tools and resources are not available for access.  Some tools are not compatible with versions.   Poor in compatible resources or tools between offsite and onsite work (time waste).  Hardwares or attachments (sockets) are missing, broken, or checked out.  Getting projects set up for running is more of a 'tangle operation'.

The company is making many transformational changes in the right direction, changes that will drive growth.
cons: Within several Maketing groups you have the chosen few that have grown up through the organization. These women are untouchable, sighting themselves as Daughters of the VP’s. If you’re approved by as an it girl you’ll succeed, if not you’re doomed for failure. The consumer SBA is probably the worst environment and they create Sunshine committees to pretend everything is great. In reality it’s like a high school drama scene.

cons: I have never seen a company as bad as this. They are extremely cheap and their salaries show you just how cheap they are. No matter how you perform you never get a raise. The culture of the company is to come in and outbid others so that the client can't so no. Cut the sizing of the staff and overload what is left with multiple jobs and one salary. There is no structure nor organization on projects. Management lies repeatedly and will tell you what they think you need to hear and give you false hope. It is nearly impossible to get fired. People can literally fight you if they want and still have a job. There is no professionalism at all. The language barrier is hard enough but the comprehension barrier is worse.

cons: Corporate management's ever-changing mandates, procedures and audits.

Corporate management's obsession with improving the ""customer experience"" yet having no clue what that is (except a mighty-cool-sounding corporate buzzword).

[pros: -Flexible Schedule
-Supervisors are easy to work with
-Almost always work available if you want it
-Work can be relaxing if you get into it and have thick skin
-One of few part time jobs in the B/CS area that pay more than min. wage (~$10/hr)
-Policies are necessarily harsh, but forgiveness is usually the M/O if you approach the hiring staff with an issue and have a good record.
cons: This is titled: ""Part time job"", and that's all it is. Keep your head down, stay out of lines of fire, get paid. If you are looking for anything more than a little cash while you are a Texas A&M student- a place to grow, learn, thrive, or otherwise have a positive experience- you will walk away empty-handed. Except for a bit of cash, of course. 

-Unforgiving policies (that are rightfully in place) don't always give leeway when it is deserved

-Pay raises are dirt, and rarely are bonuses offered for needed work. 

-Callous and almost hostile atmosphere at times

-All levels of authority from dispatch to Director are inept, hostile, and continually frustrated. Best to stay out of their line of sight at all times. You will do well to just keep your head down and mouth shut.

-A culture of 'I alone know everything, you are an idiot' trickles down from the highest levels

-Department is poorly funded for its needs. Imagine if an equipment-heavy branch of the military like the Air Force was funded by giving them 75% of their costs incurred by equipment maintenance alone. They would use half of it on machinery, cut a lot of corners to make ends meet, and try to scrape by with the rest in all other areas.

[pros: Learned to work in a fast pace environment, became good at multitasking a lot of costumer needs and the needs of my managers. It helped me develop good costumer service skills for example speaking to the public and my peers.
cons: Not a great place to stay at for the long term. Most of my colleagues were middle age and their attitude towards the job was depressing or competitive, in terms they would steal sales. The position was based on sales so the more you sold the more hours received. Was not expecting that when receiving the position.

[pros: KISD is a great organization to work for in the general sense of the word. Days off during the summer, retirement and most of the people I worked with were professional and caring.

cons: I've been propositioned by 2 senior leaders (who are married)...this is the weirdest thing. It makes me wonder if they are in cahoots. I've never in my entire career experienced anything more unprofessional. There are changes that are allegedly being made and sure, there have been some small updates. Most of it is smoke and mirrors. Our managers that lack experience aren't retaining anything they learn from training. it's just a huge waste of time and so very disappointing to keep the same people and try to teach them how to lead. We need new people. Trying to teach these old dogs new tricks just isn't working. And unfortunately, the company is having a hard time letting them go because of the gross nepotism.

[pros: It's an airline job.  For those who have been bitten, it's pretty much like every other airline.  Flight benefits can be a pro, but flights are always full so it can be difficult to fly standby.  There is a 20% discount if you want to pay for your ticket and fly positive space.  Nothing outstanding about this company, but nothing that is horrible by comparison to other airlines.
cons: Promotions to management are often based on inter-office politics rather than filling positions with the right people.  There are also way too many managers and directors than necessary.  Also, there is an 8% cap on how much of a raise you can get if you get promoted.

[pros: The company recently changed to an open time off policy, which is a great benefit. They also offer a lot of employee resource groups and internal events.
cons: Despite the open time off policy, this is a company with an old fashioned mindset. There is innovation happening here - but you wouldn't know it. There is very little communication across units, sometimes even within the same department. It seems like people have either been here for years and years, or two years and under. A lot of people are set in their ways and not open to change, even when it's for the better. You have to be proactive about your own personal development here - it's not a culture that talks about it openly, so you need to find your own outlets for it.

Clients you build great relationships with will be automatically reassigned to other FC’s making it impossible to accomplish anything. Enjoy doing nothing but customer service work and force feeding any and all clients a goal plan or you’ll be low man on the Totem pole and constantly overlooked. You’re unable to give any advice or help to clients and you will quickly lose all industry knowledge and your quality of conversations with clients will decline quickly.

- You will have to work with people who are barely capable of chewing their own food let alone being in an advanced position that requires some actual thought and planning to do.
- They constantly push us to sell services and labs but the team that runs that and does the pricing for us is a bunch of inept idiots. They transferred someone from their labs in Chicago to help the reps but she has absolutely no idea what she is doing and should be working as a janitor before being in the role she is in.
- The ""trainings"" they make you go to several times per week are redundant and run by people who have no idea what we are supposed to sell.

[pros: No pros for this company as such. If you see the history of this company, founded in the same year as Infosys. Look at where Infosys is and where is this company today. This itself tells the underlying story. All smart people will understand what I am trying to say.
cons: I worked almost 1 year in this company's in-house project before deployed in client place for another 1 year. 
Compensation benefits are not only way beyond the minimum industry standard, but also , they some time don't give or delay your own hard earn money such as onsite deputation compensation ( 3K INR only per month at that time! ).
The team lead and beyond management is just demotivating and they do nothing but pass the blame to the junior Engineer ( most of the time those Engineers are fresher or with 2-3 years of exp, with lot of talent, but with out any clue of what to do next or without any vision because of their immediate team lead and manager ). 
I am so disappointed even the way they have done my final settlement after my resignation. The variable pay which I was eligible for ( because I was deputed in the client place and client has given very good feedback for my work ), they didn't give to me.
In short, I had a pathetic experience of 2 years with this company.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: There’s a lot to learn and a lot of opportunity. If you are willing to stay the pay is extremely well, two and a half years in you start getting two bonuses a year worth 6k each time. Once you become a level 5 area manager you have the opportunity to use the trail blazer program to get into corporate such as software development, finance, project management, etc.
cons: Not for everyone you FORSURE WILL WORK 12 HOUR shifts. Amazon does spoil their managers though you get food often and free coffee all the time. You work 4 days and off 3 which is fine, expect politics at work and people all around you trying to get promoted. But that’s how it is in the real world, stay on your toes and do what ever you can to move up. If you get into the night shifts there’s less people to rely on and you have to do stuff on your own, but work during the day and you will have a lot of people you can rely on but a lot of people will be looking over your shoulders to make sure you’re not screwing around.] =",excellent,good,bad

[pros: I like working with so many other women, nothing against men but working here almost feels like a sorority. All the servers support each other and I've made a lot of friends. Schedule can be pretty flexible but less so than most part time serving jobs.
cons: Almost everything else is bad. Probably any other location would be better, but don't bother applying to this one.

The customers are 90% foreigners who don't know or care that they're supposed to tip. Most girls actually write ""tips are appreciated"" and suggested amounts on the receipts. I feel rude doing this, I have been trained at all my other serving jobs not to mention tips because it's rude. My tip average every night is never more than 10%, and many many customers leave 5% or nothing. I have been a server several times at different kinds of restaurants and nowhere has ever been this bad for tips. So please believe this is not me being a bad server, my past management has praised my serving abilities.

Which brings me to my next point, most of the managers here do not appreciate me no matter how hard I work, no matter that I show up every day on time and a lot of girls no call no show. There are only 4 managers for a very busy restaurant and the owners are too cheap to employ more management in spite of badly needing it.

I have never seen so many walk outs in my life. All my other restaurants I could probably count the walk outs on one hand, over my whole time working there. Here it happens ridiculously often. The owners and therefore management blames the servers for these walk outs, as if we have any way to force people to pay. They act like we aren't wasting our time and effort to lose a tip when this happens.  Until they have security or something to prevent this, there's nothing we can do and they need to stop writng us up for things out of our control. That's extremely unfair and it's clear they don't value their employees at all.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: When I first started working here I enjoyed going to work everyday. The culture of the office was great, there were exciting projects to work on, and everyone had wonderful things to say about Weston. There were plenty of new opportunities to learn and grow and I felt that they hired me at a very reasonable salary.
cons: Within the past two years things have continually become worse. Since the company is in financial trouble, management is making decisions to improve the situation, but at the expense of their employees. Morale is extremely low and almost every single employee is looking for a different opportunity and dislikes coming to work everyday. Due to layoffs, employees have been expected to take on increasing amounts of responsibility, with absolutely no raises or incentives. They recently switched to a different management structure where employees no longer have a local supervisor, they are managed by someone out of state who doesn't even know them. It leaves the employee feeling like no one cares and gives them no one to go to when they need help. Additionally, because they have managed to run away all their best employees, they are hiring people who are very low performers, which is extremely frustrating for the few people who are still there. All of the great employees are completely overworked and under recognized and over the time I worked there my pay increased only a small fraction.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

cons: The pay isn't great, the time between clients is too quick, and they will push you to upsell products and services that your clients may not want or need. the pay is low and hourly plus commission on upsold products and services. the extra pay for deep tissue is not worth the extra amount of work or wear and tear on your body. deceptive about selling a ""one hour massage"" and only allowing 50 minutes for the session.

Store managers/ Directors will find fault with long term full timers to keep them on the edge of termination, and they have used many times medical conditions as a basis to terminate employees which is legal in Florida due to the poor lax in employment laws. The merge with Buy-Lo has made conditions worse as Store Managers/Directors receive bonuses for slashing hours, which they do with devastating effects on the stores reputation as it causes dissatisfaction with customers who see poorly handled perishable products, long lines at cash registers, and declining employee morale.Refusal to allow employees to take breaks or lunches on shifts from 5-8 hours which is also legal in Florida and causes drop in morale.] =",terrible,bad,bad

- Lots of employee enrichment (read: free swag)
- great training 
- lots of opportunities to see other areas of the company.
- work from home is a great option that promotes a pretty good experience of trying to build community 
- pretty good for getting time off
cons: - the metrics they measure you on can be unreasonable because if some random person you helped does not apple policy and takes it out on you in a review, you are expected to some how have known how to fix their attitude. 

- expectations of time between calls is pretty bad. Some of these calls can be really taxing just because of a bad attitude or lack of knowledge from the person you are helping.

[pros: The small size of the office and knowledgeable, friendly CPAs make the company a great place to learn about auditing.  They're well managed in that they don't bite off more work than they can chew, so there's always time to slow down and do the job right the first time.  Additionally, since the firm specializes in employee benefit plan audits, they have a great system in place to complete audits quickly and efficiently and still hit all the areas as thoroughly as needed.  Lastly, the managing partner is pretty good about giving back to the team in ways that range from paying thanks, parties, and sponsoring trips to local events.
cons: Because of the specialization, you're not likely to see audits outside of employee benefit plans.  Also, keep in mind that the local level focus means that there isn't a lot of travel opportunities, which could be a plus or minus depending on your view.] =",excellent,good,excellent

cons: Compensation strategy is beyond trash and borderline abuse. As the title states: if you want a yearly raise, or a title change, or even just a simple merit bonus GOOD LUCK! You will need to leave to get more money, plain and simple. You can be one of the best employees out there with an amazing performance review and you WILL have to fight an uphill battle to get compensated what you are worth.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: Once you have the day-to-day tasks mastered, the job is pretty smooth sailing and nothing extraordinary. Promotions can happen fast as long as you actually work hard and get things done. Great full time benefits: make sure to take advantage of their 401K. Having a pharmacy tech license will get you a raise. I had the privilege of working with a great manager, but the manager really does make or break the job.
cons: Pay is average. They start a shift lead at around $15 (depending on the state) and you get reviews once a year that give you the chance for a small increase to your pay.

cons: If you do not know anyone, you have 0 chances of promotion. It is ALL about who you know and who you hang out with. I have seen it happened multiple times where much more deserving people do not get a promotion because these people do not go to happy hours with the right persons. They have promoted people that have a history of discrimination as a manager and I was personally discriminated against by this person. All they care about is the production, production, production. They throw you a bone here and there and make it look like they did you a favor so you can work even harder. They came up with a big Career Path to make it equal for everyone to be able to pursue a promotion but that only worked for a while because only respected for the mundanes. And the CEO??  Beside throwing huge parties and spending tons of money on it, what about giving raise to your hard working employees? People that know him personally are his disciples. From an outside perspective, he looks like a guru and they all drink his words surrounded by his security guards. Every time he comes to the HQ, it is like Queen Elizabeth is in town.

[pros: Q2 has a super strong push to their culture, our mission is that we strengthen communities and it really shows in employee attitudes.

Q2 does all the little things right. They give (small) gifts of appreciation every quarter just to know they're thinking of us. They also try to realize when a majority of the workforce is stressed but their efforts to make that better are often ineffective but I still appreciate the sentiments. The response to COVID-19 has been nothing short of phenomenal as well. Q2 was one of the first companies to send everyone fully WFH and our CEO claims we'll be one of the last companies to come back into the office.

There's a ton of free food.

Open PTO plan and the health plan is the cheapest I've ever seen.

The pay is decent but the stock program is amazing. Stocks vest on a 4 year plan and Q2 stock is usually a firm 'buy' based on professional analysis. This last year my vesting stocks was roughly 1/3 of my total income.

I think upper management realizes morale is low right now and it working on improving it which, in my opinion, shows they care.

A surprisingly large number of Q2 employees have been with the company a very long time (7+ years). I don't see that very often in Austin and I think that speaks volumes.
cons: Q2 is currently trying to become profitable and that's been rough on the employees. In late 2018 it was announced all pay raises would be put on hold. Some employees did finally get raises halfway through 2020 despite still not being profitable but I honestly think that has more to do with COVID-19 and trying to recover lost morale rather than putting employees first. I would not be surprised if something similar happens in 2021.

Weekend work will happen and it will likely happen on very short notice. Management has rationalized this by saying we have an open PTO plan to make up for it but due to workload very few people are able to actually utilize the unlimited PTO to make up for the lost weekends.

Q2 has grown very quickly and we're at a weird point where we have some massive customers that can dictate how we work. Because of this it doesn't feel like projects are run very efficiently and we're constantly rushing from fire to fire based on the whims of our largest customers. If you're placed on one of these projects it can be very disheartening very quickly. Management also seems to only want to keep the client happy without care for employee morale.

Q2 is also very segmented. In implementations we work in several different pods, some of which have wildly different responsibilities. Project managers struggle to understand what pods do what and this leads to a lot of internal conflict. In my experience because of this a lot of technical positions that have been with Q2 for a while tend to take ownership of parts of a project they should have no involvement with solely because the PM doesn't understand who should be doing what work.

Upper management changed quite a bit between 2016 and 2018 which really set us back, we're just now recovering from that and it's not uncommon for folks around the office to still complain about those turbulent times.

We tend to celebrate near misses rather that good jobs being done. Every quarter we have an all hands that has an awards component to it. Each aware always has an anecdote on how the awardee did something above and beyond to rescue a project from certain failure. These aren't things that went well, these are projects that were neglected until the 11th hour and then a majority of the project was done in the final 2-3 weeks. We don't seem to learn from these mistakes and glorify the pain that these team members went through. If you work on a team that runs smoothly you'll most likely not be noticed because everything is running smoothly.] =",good,neutral,excellent

[pros: New hires get a good hike if you can join early 
Location flexibility : Bangalore, hyderbad, pune, mumbai, chennai
Can get hikes by submitting resignation anytime during the year
If you are in a practice you can enjoy by not doing any work in the project as the supervisor is in a different project and does not care
cons: Useless Senior management without ability to handle stakeholders
Work life balance is affected with people requesting time off on weekends and even during emergencies 
Aggressive project contracts which are impossible to deliver and hence stress on employees
No good technical team members in the practices , all are old legacy mentality and technology
 If you dont find a project in 2 months they will fire you 
If you resist the senior managements weekend work request you will put in Performance improvement and fired with performance issue stated in the reliving letter
Office facilities , infrastructure , laptops are pathetic

[pros: Note: The below is from my experience and opinion. Anyone not comfortable, ignore the review and read an other one.

The Company is a pioneer BPO, Beware and dont be carried away, The Standard has been a steady decline, it had hit its bottom.

Less work pressure, Well, the Pros could have been a lenghthy list, Say Training, employee welfare, however, one couldnt say all those.
work stations are ergonomic - Thanks to GE (who build the uppal facility) 
All processes are easy and can be negotiated with in your 9 hours shift.
Lots of dayshft processes - so worth giving a shot.
Promotions - Similar to all the companies - politics and favoratism does exists
Learning and educational cource offered @ genpact - Well honestly all the companies provide them, nothing significant.

I Gotta rate them 2 Star rating instead of 1- as their business model still works with a below par pay structure (Gotta give it to the higher management for the strategies which they had come up with) - it works.
cons: Training - almost Nil (Cost involved)
Compensation - Way below industry standard
Cab facility - Smartly designed (got to give it) coz it discorages employees to use cabs

Ambience and comfort in office - A/C wouldnt work most time. (Lobbies it does work, not on the floor)
Pray everyday a client visists (As A/C would work when Clients are around as they are humans and we are ?) 

Most of Middle management - are now below par compared to 5 years earlier ( why, they all moved to other companies) and hence a very mediocre standard and knowledge. ""You get what you pay for""
Team outings and other activities where cost is involved - Forget it
Few companies would recruit you one level below Genpact Designation (be aware)
The design of GE - GECIS and DNA of 6 Sigma has disappeared. Ask any one who joined post 2006, they would be oblivious to this.
One of the cornerstones of Genpact ""Integrity"" is very questionable when comes to information transfer between 
Management and Customers.( This is sensitive and leagal - Cant explain )

Every silly operation procedure would take a Ticket, followed by 1 st level escalation, then a 2nd escalation. Nothing works as a profesional environment. If you are in middle managment - watchout.( it becomes annoying beyond a point ) ( In a while you get used to it, however, its a skill which you woulnd need elsewhere)

HR is redefined - designation counts in everything. It used to be a forem where you can voice out and action was taken. now dont even dream. if you are an associate escalating a AM, AM wins. if you are an AM escalating about an M, then M wins. (AM- Assistant Manager, M - Manager)

HYD- they have a new facility in pocharam, now thats a bit far for most folks, so watch out where you would be placed. (Its a highway and rediculous traffic - Few fatalities reported) - best advise is use the company bus from uppal. 

Get water bottles to office, apparently cups are very expensive to provide (this is where it reaches the heights of cost cutting) - or those who have been to US, know in US offices they dont have cups either, but a water dispenser from which you can direclty drink. That equipments costs. and hence .... you know what am going to say.

New applicants - be patient with HR (They are under a tremendrous stress) coz they had to recruit almost 365 days. they come across to u very rude most times and pretty unprofessional. coz the attrition is really healthy. Cant really blame the First line HR. Pity.

Finally - Before taking a carrier decision please talk to an employee who is atlest 4 years in the organisation and a close friend. Those who read reviews, please take a min and give your inputs aswell. It really does help. Thank you] =",bad,terrible,excellent

[pros: There is good money to make here for a relatively easy job. If you can only focus on you, and not everything else you will do fine here. Also the management I was under was great, for the most part.
cons: 100% commission. This and they have a ""programming and setup fee"" that you don't have to charge, but you're strongly encouraged to. In a day and age when phones program and set themselves up upon unboxing, it felt unethical to charge it, so a lot of the times I didn't. I lost a lot of money because of that.  Others would charge the fee when they didn't do anything.  Also you are charged back on something a customer deactivates 6 MONTHS after they buy it! 100% of what you made. So even though the company still made a little money, you lose 100% of what you made. That's absurd. Also if someone stole something at the store and you didn't know about it, they would charge you back for the missing item if you worked that day.

Lastly the culture. Holy smokes this was my #1 reason for leaving. 100% commission caused a lot of bad culture in the workplace. Fights would constantly break out about what customer should've been who's, if someone was down in their month then everybody had to know about it and they would bring everybody else down. My coworkers would talk very demeaning towards women, management knew about it, but never did anything because they hit their sale numbers. Just bad culture.
In summary The programming and setup fee, charge backs, and culture was the reason I left here, and I will never go back unless they change those things.

They say there is a work/life balance, but there isn't. I would constantly have to cover shifts that others wouldn't, resulting in me working many doubles, and 6 days a week. When you work extra, what happens is that can make your average of sales to hours worked go down, which results in you not being able to move up, or even having to go to extra training out of town, even though you might have worked harder than everybody else.

Also pay is 3 months behind which was kinda nice because after I quit I kept getting massive checks, but it sucked when I worked there because I didn't really make a lot.] =",bad,terrible,terrible

[pros: By-far the most diverse and accepting organization I've worked for. Differences are embraced and personality/style is encouraged. Very much a relaxed and informal work culture, and if you're even slightly inspired by or interested in music, you'll enjoy it here. Everyone here has a work-hard, play-hard mentality where work comes first especially around major holiday and sales events, but spontaneous jam sessions will happen around the office from time-to-time which is always a highlight. Great perks if you're a musician building your rig, actively gigging, or are even slightly interested in learning an instrument for the very first time. There's a lot of opportunity to work your way up and around within the organization. In my short time here, I saw several colleagues in various departments earn promotions, which is definitely a resume-builder. The organization itself has a ton of areas of opportunities for growth, so it's also a great place to learn various skill sets and work in a cross-departmental way that will broaden your scope of knowledge.
cons: As you will quickly learn, the company has many inefficient back-office processes and redundancies that keep it from scaling as quickly as it could otherwise. Resources are stretched thin and within the eCommerce department alone, there are many teams that could use a significant amount of additional headcount. A caveat to being able to advance your role within a relatively short amount of time is that in entry or mid-level roles in particular, pay does not increase respectively as it should and is on the lower end of the market average. The company is very top-heavy with manager-level employees without direct reports and as you'll quickly see, a promotion, even to a manager-level position, will not necessarily redefine the role but will instead result in new responsibilities being tacked onto old ones. There is quite a bit of turnover as some employees become unsatisfied with how slowly it takes new ideas to come to fruition and be executed upon, since systems, processes, and resources lag behind. Throughout time of employment at Guitar Center (<1 year), I saw 3 or 4 coworkers  leave the company to advance their careers at larger, tech-oriented companies for many of these reasons. As far as benefits go, pay is a little weak, benefits for musicians are strong, Vision is A+, Dental is A-Grade as well, but Health is a C-.] =",good,good,excellent

[pros: Great Product that works in most tech stacks.
cons: Unless you are promoted internally, you will have an extreme challenge succeeding in your role. Favoritism is an understatement here. It is the classic ""Best sellers make the best leaders"" (They don't) and if you do not fit the mold of your manager, you will be shunned like an ugly duckling. Leadership is the main problem here. With a massive ""selling bro"" as the director, anyone who was not in a frat, didn't play lacrosse or doesn't enjoy drinking with their coworkers till 4 AM on a Wednesday will be looked at as a ""loser"". Middle management tries to provide an open door policy, but slip up and say anything negative and you can expect to be forced to quit via an unachievable PIP or fired on the spot. When in the interviewing process, ask the managers how many people have been on and off their team over the past calendar year. Ask how many reps an account goes through before being closed out. Ask the director how they train/empower their leaders. Ask how many reps have quit the job without any other jobs lined up (The number is staggering).] =",neutral,terrible,bad

Pay is poor, benefits are few and expensive, work / life balance is terrible for managers, and hours can be long and stressful. I often feel sorry for the hard working people who receive so little in return. Seems to be turning into a fast-food type environment with high turn over, no longer a ""specialty"" neighborhood bakery/cafe that used to offer superior products and service.

[pros: I haven't noticed anything good as I spent only 1 year there
cons: Not sure where to start with but let me start from hiring,
1.I asked for director position but the recruiter told me that the role has opened for Associate director role only but after I agreed with the offer they asked me to apply to a role which has a mention of ""Tower Director"" . When I question them, I didnt received any response but as I already decided to join them, i went ahead and joined
2. Post joining I was eager to start taking care of the role I discussed but then to my shock I noticed I had been put into a role which is way different than what I was interviewed for. When I raised this point, I didn't receive any satisfactory response from the stakeholders. It's a challenge in cognizant to get support in such cases from both Leaders and HR and seems it's a regular practice which is being followed.
3. I spent a few months and though I managed to build rapport with clients I was not happy with the role as it was not the type of work which will help me grow. I started talking to my leadership for a change in program and then I was told that I cannot be released before 1 year and that's cognizant policy.
How come making someone work in a role which he/she was not interviewed for and does not use their skill set properly makes sense? It seems cognizant is more focused on putting bodies in their engagement rather than helping people grow professionally
4.You cannot have visibility of relevant work unless you come out of your existing engagement. Also even after coming out they will try within the same practice first , irrespective of the mismatch . I was told to find a matching engagement of my own first and then go to the open pool. Why? If I dont know of any such engagement and go to an open pool, I will be given 3 weeks time to find a suitable one at any location and if I dont move into any billable role, I will be asked to leave in another 2 weeks.

That's where I realized that Cognizant is not at all a good place to work for as they lack transparency, professionalism and ethics.

Also, they change policies to hurt people who are leaving them. I noticed after leaving that, they have only paid for 5 days of unused PTO instead for all the days. The reason is, they changed their policy with immediate effect and there was no communication sent to people who are leaving. Whereas the programs are requesting people to give notice to help them out. So , cognizant is billing customers for the time and also exploiting people who are helping them but not paying them their earned leaves.

If you do not have any ambition or looking for a professional environment or growth related aspiration then go for cognizant.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: Large, recognised company 

Prompt salary payments 

London bank experience 

Working from home 

Expenses providing you have budget
cons: Piecemeal and not specific enough induction process. 

Allocation of very old laptops is common. 

Getting confirmation of whether you are meeting objectives throughout the year isn't easy. Tactics are increasingly being employed to advise staff that targets have been narrowly missed with the net result being ""Sorry, you aren't getting a bonus"".  

Unfortunately, the 'skill' in project management at LBG is centred around navigating the highly complex and time consuming delivery process. 

Email is heavy. Projects demand tons of conference calls. Getting a standard issue Blackberry just adds to the traffic. 

5-6 hours of compliance CBT work per quarter. 

Practice managers expect handover activity for > 1 week holidays but finding someone to take on projects in flight is a challenge. 

Having to do extra work for business transformation isn't trivial. Not doing it is seen as failure to go the extra mile is used as at appraisal time. 

Opportunities to undertake overseas assignments (my interest) are now very limited as LBG as operations are being actively pulled back to the UK. 

Upon leaving, the manager I wished I had admitted that ""we now expect too much from our project managers"" which was an interesting admission. 

Contractors rule the roost at LBG. Actually, it would be much better to be a contractor who have dedicated and focused management, generally good day rates and paid overtime!] =",bad,terrible,excellent

There's opportunity for growth, you just have to be willing to do the work and stay focused for yourself.  You will get to travel. Make the best of where you are, it may not be where you want to go but hey you didnt have to pay for it to go, so have FUN while you are there.

- Management is all politics

- WORKING AT BBG CAN BRING YOU CAREER RISK AS WELL BECAUSE FINANCE IS A SMALL WORLD AND PEOPLE TALK.

If you're not in the favorites circle then you're out! No matter how or what you do to improve it will never be enough. Management forms opinions of employees based on others personal opinions rather than professionally addressing root issues and working on resolutions. There's a huge lack of communication, respect, and training in this company.  There is no open door policy and management tends to dismiss your concerns if they don't want to listen to complaints or ideas. Company Policy and Procedures are only followed if it benefits managements and there is only repercussions in the company to the employees outside of the favorites circle. High levels of micromanaging and unrealistic goals to employees who are not favorable. Passing blame or fault onto unflavored employees happens daily and management will only communicate with favored employees who are passing blame. It's a very bullied work environment that creates unnecessary stress, negativity, and a lot of CYA.

[pros: The company provides good benefits and working conditions.  They encourage further education.  If your clinic met the marks that they set for you, such as patient satisfaction, timely appointments etc. each employee would receive a bonus.  This was on top of the regular company profit bonuses they give annually.
cons: Company did seem to be very profit driven.  Collecting co-payments was a MUST and if you failed to do so you would get written up.  Administration needs to take employee complaints more seriously.  The family clinic where I worked went through 4 front desk people in the less than 3 years that I was there.  They left because of dissatisfaction with management.  There were so many changes being made, no consistency or true leadership.] =",excellent,neutral,bad

[pros: - good benefits (e.g. private insurance with vitality), good (corporate) discounts in London
- some nice colleagues (though in my opinion, smart people leave quickly - high employee turnover)
- modern office with free snacks and drinks
- great summer parties
- it looks good on a CV 
- the company is successful mainly due to the network effect, its products are rooted in the operations of financial institutions so it seems to me that Bloomberg will stay profitable for now
cons: - micromanagement culture, no flexibility (little flexibility with wfh, working hours, ways of working), old-schooled non-innovative practices, it feels like a very American corporate culture
- long working hours. they claim it's normal for the financial industry however, the salaries are not as high as in finance. Looking from the financial industry point of view: working hours okay but low salary; looking from non-finance related industries: long working hours but okay salary - though if you calculate per hour value, it is relatively low
- a very process-oriented company with very few innovations
- claimed to be flat structured, in reality very hierarchical, your seniority and contacts/politics matter a lot, if you are young/new you are expected to smile and do whatever you are told by your manager/older peers without questioning it, critical and outside of the box thinking is not appreciated. in my opinion little respect for people on entry or not-senior level positions
- internal politics and contacts matter more than your work results and knowledge 
- career progression depends on your manager, if they like you, you are lucky. your aspirations on the career path have little importance, the business need is of utmost importance
- to me, it seems like there is high employee turnover and that some teams operate in a very toxic way, it sometimes felt suffocating 
- culture of Bloomberg-praising, if you speak loudly and positively of Bloomberg you'll be noticed. in my opinion, it feels almost like daily Bloomberg propaganda
- you learn in your first 1 or 2 years, later the skills and work techniques are very Bloomberg specific, hence not transferable to other jobs and industries (even basic softwares like Outlook, Teams, slack are not used at Bloomberg, instead they have their own ones)] =",terrible,bad,good

cons: Groups constantly seem understaffed.  Management is glorified.  I have found that often, managers lack experience in true HR related issues and don't understand what certain benefits are, such as types of disability leave.

[pros: Great perks, awesome people to work with. 

You get an iphone/samsung of your choice, no limit on data/roaming, if anything is wrong with it you get a new one no questions asked. Same for your laptop. 

International travel is unlimited and at your own discretion, as long as there's a valid business porpuse obviously. You fly Business when it's a long enough flight, so some people take connection flight to qualify. 

Free food and snacks, lots of options, virtually unlimited budgets for team get-togethers, etc. 

Pay and comp are on the highest standards in the industry.
cons: High pressure. People get fired if they under perform, and under perform may not be what you expect it to be. Employee evaluation is mainly ""impact"" based - meaning you have to show measureable product impact every half. 

This creates insensitives for people to produce low quality code, and under-maintaining it, since you are better off solving 90% of the problem and say you're done without covering edge cases. 

This also pressures people to work alone on highly measureable projects and not share the credit for larger projects. 

in the year and a half I've been with the company, I've seen 4 people fired in a 30~ person team, plus two more quit ahead of being fired. On other teams, however, I've seen people rest-and-vest for years, so it's probably very dependent on the team and managers.] =",neutral,good,excellent

[pros: Great benefits and plenty of PTO
cons: The LMS system that is used is exceptionally old and outdated. They have done tweaks on the homepage and adjusted a few things but the website almost always has errors. Often when families upload documentation for enrollment the upload does not take properly and does not show as being needed for review. The Enrollment Details page of the LMS systems for families does not accurately reflect what we can accept for documentation. Connections Academy hires temporary employees who are poorly trained: they give families inaccurate information, and also do not understand how to properly review documentation. As a result, of this productivity is not acknowledged when I'm correcting mistakes to keep positive end results for families attempting enrollment. Allegedly our numbers look good but is that happening with evaluation systems that aren't looking at the full picture? The Family Enrollment Counselors are cleaning up mistakes all the while being responsible for escalated caretakers who are livid about the enrollment process. The escalated parents will scream, use foul language, and this is no exaggeration. We will have call after call of complaints about mistakes on our end but we also have to deal with uncooperative parents. These uncooperative parents are being given a 100% free education and treat employees however they please. The only direction we are given is to try and de-escalate the situation. We are asked to avoid placing these households with Senior Family Enrollment Counselors. In the past couple of years, my job requirements have increased and we are not properly supported. The systems used to evaluate productivity in my role is flawed. This was something discovered by several people in my position. This in itself likely contributed in affecting raises and the potential for anyone to move onto other positions in the company. It's widely know by my colleagues that the rate of pay for Family Enrollment Counselor role is not the same across the board. Many of us in my role are aware that the pay is not accurately reflecting the amount of work we do. This year they decided to direct Academic Placement Services questions to Family Enrollment Counselors. We were initially directed to discuss placement questions about households in a chat. This chat has upwards to about four people there who often are to busy to answer. What's the point of this chat if nobody is going to answer in a timely manner? Yes we were provided basic information but did anyone consider we can't review documentation or have the same permissions they do? I only say this because this causes longer hold times on the phone. Eventually once it was discovered it wasn't working we were asked to direct calls to placement queue that has little coverage. During busy season responsibilities change and people are put on teams for targeted campaigns. Even so it's hard for everyone to cover everything. Issue Aware tickets can go un-noticed and as a result could hold up someone's opportunity to enroll. The school leadership are also given full reign on how they want things done. They will deliberately ask us to postpone sending tickets to them when we have parents calling in day after day for answers. They also have outdated requirements for acceptable documentation for parents to provide. Thing is these school leaders don't deal with the ramifications of these choices for acceptable documents. Also unfortunately we cannot communicate with them ourselves and offer our insights on the expectations they have set for the school. Finally the micromanaging here is unacceptable. You have tell people when you go on your break, you have to tell people when you go on lunch, we were told to only use one ten-minute personal break a week, but wait need extra time after a call? Don't forget to update everyone. In other words, where is the trust in the person you hired? It was my understanding leadership has full access to my schedule and can see when I change my status on our phone system. It's all ridiculously unnecessary and I imagine that was put into place because the work force management team is no longer there. Or perhaps someone just wants to add on more unnecessary steps. Who knows anymore. Our resources here are often outdated and we are given broken links to resources. Trust these issues are mentioned to the appropriate people but what can a measly employee do?] =",bad,bad,excellent

[pros: The best reason to work for Office Depot is the pay.  Although I didn't always see eye to eye with management, my pay check was worth me going to work everyday.  Office Depot was the highest paying job I ever had and I wasn't even at the top to make decent money.  If I needed to go back, unfortunately, it would only be for the money, because at the end of the day I wasn't 100% satisfied with my job.  Eventually, I looked for other opportunities and decided that it was better for me to take less pay and work a job that I enjoy.
cons: Some of the downsides of working at Office Depot is upper management not appreciating the hard work and efforts that you put into your store.  Its all about ""numbers"" and if your ""numbers"" are not where they need to be, then basically you're worth nothing.  All of the other things that you do that's a part of your job and not to forget, the extras are definitely overlooked and not appreciated.  If you are a new assistant manager coming into Office Depot, expect to be put into a store that ""needs improvement"".  Therefore, don't expect the promised ""bonus"".] =",good,bad,excellent

cons: New management and ownership within the last couple years with the promises of much better things to come. It hasn't trickled down to those doing the work, doubt it will. Staff is extremely overworked, stressed, loyal and been given the promises of raises/bonuses that haven't come. Mgmt preaches 'People Matter' but I've not figured out which people matter, it isn't hard working staff, it must be the board members. Companies are acquired and products sold without anyone knowing how they work or interact with other products or if they'll work with core products.

[pros: Great team work, enthusiastic and committed management.
cons: Have been with the company for many years, it has changed an awful lot. Stay away if you have young children, flexibility at the drop of a hat is key with this company (and very one sided too). Dependants are not taken into consideration, If they become ill, you're expected to to find someone else to look after your own, poorly children. The name is extremely ironic.

Needs of the business are first and foremost above everything. The company offers part time contracts as a majority, 24 hr is very rare. So for working mums out there, be expected to pay out childcare fees - for a 4 hour shift! shifts are not ""school time"" friendly. However, that said, if you are in a position that allows you to be fully flexible and change work patterns at very short notice, you will be noticed.

Knowledge now counts for nothing regarding pay, if you are a car sit fitter, that's classed as a skill, - great stuff! If you have been on all departments over the years, with a fair stack of knowledge wedged behind but can't fit a carseat - your skills are zero, unlucky! Knowledge is paramount, but is unaccounted for - given the nature of the business!] =",terrible,bad,excellent

[pros: It depends on what region you are in. Some regional sales managers are better than others.  Some are not very intelligent and not caught up on the times.  It is a stable job with decent (but expensive) benefits.  They do not like to fire employees, generally speaking.
cons: The company as a whole has a very bad reputation in some parts of the country. They make a decent, sub top-tier commercial product, offered at a top-tier price.  That will make it more difficult for you to sell. Very negative culture, where everyone will blame someone else. No teamwork; plenty of backstabbing. 

Some managers are stuck in their old school thinking ways, will shun new ideas, and play favorites. They do not value formal education in the slightest. They put on a facade with the fancy headquarters building, but do your research in to Akron, OH if you plan to go the corporate route. It's not a pretty place to be. 

Folks have a tendency to get complacent and stay with the company for an extended period of time.  Sometimes their whole career.  While this can be a good thing, it's often a con, as they rarely open up to fresh ideas.  Managers are promoted purely on tenure, rather than merit, so oftentimes they have no business managing others.  Expect a manager, not a leader.  This type of culture breeds mediocrity - a fact represented by their stock price (down 65% in the last 1.5 years) and their decreasing market share to Bridgestone and Michelin.

[pros: You get paid on time that’s a good thing but often there are mistakes by the payroll department. That makes you nervous. You better keep track of your numbers / deductions every time.  

Benefits are OK, not really great. 401K was at 2% match (come on). Now it is at 4%. Medical employee share is higher as average age of the employee is high.
cons: This is a conglomerate company. They bought bunch of little companies / products and merged. Most of the times they did not do a good job in integration in product wise as well as employee wise.

Most of the jobs are tech jobs as this is a software company.

This is company of 550 full time employees (as of Jan 09). Every one is over loaded with work. No proper processes. Stepping on each other or pointing at each other.

And there is this out sourcing thing. About 100 people work from India on software development / testing. Higher management seems to be very happy with their service. So, imagine where the future leads you to.

The pay rise is a joke in the development wing. Come on way below the inflation. Their response: That’s how for across the company. You know that’s not true. 

There is no visibility and there is no direction. No focus. Most of the people work here wait to clock to tick 5:00 and wait for Friday since Monday. 

Ho many people knew that this company got de-listed from stock exchange and re-listed back after couple of years due to financial audit issues? The ticker got changed couple of time and you do not find the history.

My sincere advice: 
If you need a job then take it. Negotiate the salary high before you join. But when you get a chance leave. I know people joined and left in a week.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: The hours are flexible (at least in the operations department), and the people you work with are really great. They also employ international interns and people from all over, so it's a really nice multi-cultural environment.
cons: They seem quite miserly. It can take a while to get needed supplies, raises are few and far between, and when colleagues leave the L.A. office, new ones pop up in Orlando (presumably, because it's cheaper to hire over there). 

Also, if you read the other negative reviews about the company here, I can vouch for most if not all of those complaints as well. Those negative complaints don't affect everyone equally, but they do / did happen - if not to me, then to others I worked with. Unless you work close to the office and can live comfortably off the low wages they offer, or are in upper management (I assume), this really isn't / shouldn't be a long-term employment solution.] =",bad,bad,excellent

cons: In regard to upper management screaming at people, employees throwing each other under the bus, and upper management's salary increasing as a direct correlation to employees being laid off, this place reads more like a bad reality show than a professional place of employment.

[pros: Store closes early compared to other retailers. The 40 percent associate discount weekends are great.
cons: The cons are that there is not enough payroll.  Store Manager is the only FT person in the building at most stores. Often times you are the only
Person working in the store trying to be the cashier, work on floor moves and put out stock. IMO this is not and should not be classified as an exempt salaried position because you are unloading trucks, cashiering, stocking shelves and working freight 90% of the time. Company also has a transportation problem in that many times your truck does not get there on the date it is suppose to, and you may or may not be notified until the last minute, in which case you have to send all of the associates home after they have arrived for work, only to come back on another morning to receive in the truck. Corporate is out of touch with stores, recently in an attempt to save money they have stopped tagging merchandise or a percentage at the warehouse only to put that task on stores and did not a lot any more payroll money for this task. Technology is very outdated, platforms for hiring, reviews, scheduling and even the POS is not user friendly. They offer health insurance, 2 weeks paid vacation ( but good luck trying to take off from your store for a week) they off 6 paid sick days. NO PAID HOLIDAYS, and they do NOT reward for tenure. Only corporate employees are able to receive paid holidays or more weeks of vacation for tenure. Turn over is high because part time associates do not have benefits and the only FT person is the Store Manager. Also
Background checks should be run on all employees.] =",terrible,bad,terrible

[pros: It's an easy job that anyone can do, and only need basic people skills. Although depending on your store, you may also have great co-workers if you are lucky. But they usually leave to greener pastures pretty quickly as there is a revolving door for employees at Target. So if you have troublesome co-workers you can hope that that changes quickly as well.

The 10% discount is nice, you also get an additional 20% off some Target brand items.

You can work as little as you want if you have an additional job or are a student.
cons: I have worked at Target for 4 years part-time. Working at Target has fluctuated from a wonderful experience to a horrible soul-crushing one. It is going to depend almost entirely on who your middle and upper management are though, which can change rapidly as they transfer around to other stores frequently.

Management:
Department Managers (""Executive Team Leaders"") have ranged from generally ineffective to vindictive and hateful. They seem to mostly be fresh out of college and are hired for their looks rather than any management experience or leadership potential. There seems to be little corporate oversight on their behavior/performance other than the meeting of sales goals.The District Manager position's sole purpose seems to be as an endcap inspector during bi-monthly visits to a store.

I have really liked most of the Team Leaders (middle management) and even a couple Executive Team Leaders (upper management). But a few bad apples have basically wreaked havoc on the underlings they dislike with no repercussions. I have had two managers at various times threaten me, try to humiliate me in front of customers or co-workers, and basically just make it a horrible experience coming in to work every day. The only thing I can imagine is that they are taking their poor performance reviews/sales goals out on us, despite our hard work regardless. The bad ones obviously didn't last long behaving like that, but apparently the only way for the store manager to get rid of them seems to be to PROMOTE them to a higher position at another store. Kind of a sad joke.

A major problem has been that an HR manager was one of the worst offenders, and that's the main avenue we have to report problems. I voiced my concerns to the Store Team Leader, who was generally sympathetic and a nice guy, but it really only escalated things when he wasn't around. It's basically just ""he said, she said"" without possessing any concrete evidence, and since I can't tape record conversations legally in California, I doubt anyone would side with the lowly minimum wage Team Member. So I had to just let it go and avoid them basically. Several of us tried sending in complaints to higher avenues in the corporate ladder with no obvious effects or feedback.

Hours:
Even when hours continuously get cut, the management continues to hire new employees in a department. That no one is leaving. During the slow season. Only to have everyone's hours to get cut even more. I have often had my hours fluctuate from 30/week down to 15/week due to this. You can't really plan and adhere to a budget with such constant chaos in your paycheck. The managers doing the scheduling sometimes ignored our availability and time off requests, even ones submitted a month or two in advance. One ETL became hostile when I brought up this subject twice so I just never brought it up again. It basically left my co-workers and I to work out our schedules ourselves by trading shifts, or sometimes just calling out repeatedly if there was no other option. It's sad because a couple of the managers don't even try on the stuff that's pretty easy to get right like this.

Advancement:
Unless there is an open position, (and even if there is) don't expect to move up in the ladder any time soon without some major kissing up to the right person/people. In the last year, only one new Team Leader has been hired/promoted at my store that I know of. They were an outside hire with no retail experience, and they were hired to my department to manage as Team Lead. They were let go within 3-4 months due to incompetence I believe (which is sad because at least she tried to be nice unlike some others that never got fired) and we haven't had a replacement promotion yet for the position. So as the most experienced, I basically get to function as the Team Leader of my department, just without any of the pay, hours, benefits, or recognition. Most of my co-workers and I are/were currently in college so maybe they just don't think we plan to stay long enough to promote/develop us.

Benefits: 
Don't expect raises to go much beyond inflation (1-2% raises have been typical among my co-workers, my best raise was around 4%). However, I have worked at Target for 4 years and now get the same paycheck as new hires due to California's minimum wage rising, effectively wiping out my previous raises. Not a great way to reward your employees loyalty and knowledge. Target doesn't offer medical benefits to part-time, and they will keep you an hour under full-time to avoid giving you benefits at all costs.

[pros: The pre-J&J days were more financially rewarding to employees.  The original Alza provided a very good total compensation package which included stock options to ALL employees and an excellent stock purchase plan, which really helped motivate employees.  J&J only provides the really good compensation perks to top management.
cons: J&J did provide some good management technologies such as Process Excellence.  However, I feel that a review of management outcomes over the time since J&J bought Alza would show that a ""east coast (think big old school manufacturing)"" vs ""west coast (think innovation and high tech)"" culture clash was a major motivator in the departure of most of the highly experienced Alza ""long-timers"", you can only do so much with a steady stream of new inexperienced people.   The previous reviewers comment on the two-year rotation of senior managers from the east coast also hit the target spot on.] =",bad,bad,good

[pros: People that work there begin to become family over time. The office I worked at was less than 3 miles from my home, so therefore the commute was great. After being with the company for many years, the management team worked hard to accommodate when my child was sick and I need to leave. The company offers tuition reimbursement and they helped me to obtain my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration.
cons: There are a lot of long hours resulting in Overtime and a lot of Saturdays. The pay is ok but could be better. There is not a lot of room for growth and advancement for the company.

[pros: Good compensation when you start but not much progression otherwise lunch benefit when going to the office is very good
cons: generally treated poorly by American staff with the expectation that when they say jump you say how high. this extends to other staff in India who are treated notably worse on calls. this can extend to clear favouritism for people who've worked in the company for over 10+ years with most staff in Ireland being relatively new with the us time difference you may be forced to take after hours calls or get stuck in useless calls late in the day which have no bearing on your day to day work. the work itself varies a lot of it is boring work on legacy code working on obscure US health insurance areas. there is a lack of appetite for innovation meaning you can get stuck in repetitive tasks because that's how the planning decided the tasks should be done months ago bonuses are generally low with the excuse being that the year before had poor financial performance but if the company does well they change that to the current year or 2 years ago whichever is worse there is a corporate focus on SAFE methodology which if you've worked with it would know to avoid as a developer it's too regimented and agile in name only] =",bad,bad,bad

cons: People are promoted into management positions with no training and management skills, leaving many teams throughout Tesla with a very poor manager. Managers don't need to have basic people skills. In fact, they don't even need to be a team player. They just need to either be the ""in"" person with the chain of command and be willing to accept a position that is way over their head.] =",good,good,excellent

[pros: I have worked at Greystar for 3.5 years, in two different cities and two different roles on the corporate side. I am overwhelming grateful for the growth potential, mentorship opportunities, and fulfillment I get working for this company. More importantly, I get to bear witness (often in close proximity) to intelligent and capable national leadership. Greystar is a strong force in the multifamily industry, globally, and it’s a force you should want to be apart of. 
Pros Include:
•	Favorable Employee Benefits
•	Competitive Pay
•	Approachable Leadership, even at the top tiers
•	Flexible Work Environment- don’t get me wrong, you’ll need to work hard but it doesn’t always mean you need to be in a desk from 9-5
•	Minneapolis Team takes time to celebrate wins
•	If you do good work, you will be recognized
•	Our size allows us to test pilot the emerging trends and technology in the industry space. 
•	There are a plethora of Analyst and Associate roles that allow you to break into this space even if your relevant work-experience is limited.
cons: While my 3.5 years has been, overall, favorable. As some of our regions grow quickly, it can place a noticeable strain on our teams, especially at the property-level. While more jobs open than people to fill them, it always seems like someone is covering their own role and part of a vacant one. I hope that normalizes soon and allows us to more intentionally develop our people rather than constantly moving them. 
•	At times, can be overworked
•	Focus on getting the bottom line at properties, can take away from truly delivering the best quality to residents, depending on the circumstance
•	Being the largest mgmt. company, we have 10x more processes for things – or so it seems. It’s sort of a necessary evil. 
•	Most of the corporate career openings will be in cities other than Minneapolis. Our office is one of the smallest corporate offices around the country but there are ample openings at any time in cities like Houston, Dallas, Denver, San Francisco, Seattle, etc.] =",excellent,excellent,good

-work life balance is IMPOSSIBLE. You will literally have to choose one or the other to be successful in

[pros: There is an intense effort underway to align with new business opportunities. This opens the door for rather interesting projects that are not necessarily related to the standard retail grocery store fare. Also fairly serious about adopting ITIL throughout the (IT service) organization.
cons: Chaotic implementations leads to a glut of changes, some of which are simply abandoned in favor of the next silver bullet. 

Serious issues with lack of skilled and disciplined project managers. There is a top down effort to align the management of projects and portfolios with the larger business initiatives, but the core problem is with the line project managers -- they need training in IT project management.

Multiplicity of technologies -- tools and platforms -- leads to generalizations that are not in the best interest of building standards throughout the organization.] =",neutral,neutral,excellent

The company prefers acting before thinking, so what they do is absolute nonsense in most of the cases, and they are not really interested in comprehensive solutions.

[pros: The benefits are great, when you can use them. Managers don't allow you to use your time off (or they give you a hard time), even if you have it, so getting to the doctor or taking a vacation is nearly impossible. 

Pay is average, definitely not as much as most agencies.
cons: Poor management and little to no communication regarding company policies, benefit policies, and job performance. Management will blind-side you, telling you how great you are doing while planning your firing behind your back. Management will not support you in any way. Client makes all the rules and pretty much owns your life, while management bends over backwards to please them in any and every way, at your expense.

[pros: The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign is a great employer because it is steady.  I was always paid promptly.

I cannot speak for other's supervisor relationships.  I found the office staff to be consistently knowledgeable, helpful, and polite.
cons: I never had any significant problems at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  I wished the graduate student positions paid more.  I only worked about 10 hours a week, but my goal was mainly to cover books and groceries.  For students who work as full time TAs/GAs I know they have trouble covering cost of living.

[pros: Very steady and consistent pay structure. Most entry level sales jobs have a lower base but make up for it by providing commission incentives. Not the case at Altria. Incentive Compensation is pooled and averaged based on how you, your unit, district and section perform. This can be good or bad depending on the performance of your peers. 

Management is very supportive and wants the best for reps. Work life balance is excellent. Many reviews on here make claims to the contrary but I can't imagine an organization that has better flexibility and perks. Summer Fridays allow reps to leave early every other friday. Management is willing to let you take ""admin"" days as long as you notify your manager in advance.
cons: Unlike most sales jobs in the sense that you have very little motivation to sell. This is a ""sales"" job but you could go months without selling a single thing depending on the amount of time between new brand launch's. The job is almost exclusively focused around account management. TSM's can be successful simply by being friendly and making sure accounts know what current buydown and promotions they should be running. All these things may not sound like negatives to some because it's about as low pressure an environment you will find in any sales organization. The reason I list these as cons is because it's very easy to become complacent in this role. Selling an additional $50,000 of revenue in a month will not earn you a penny more than your peers. And lastly, the corporate structure only allows for a very linear career path. If you want to advance with Altria your Unit Manager, District Manager and Section Sales Director had better like you a lot. Promotions have very little to do with ability to sell or proficiency in your current role.] =",neutral,bad,good

[pros: Because of an extremely high attrition rate (con) , there is always a chance to move up (sadly, pro) There are also lots of lateral moves to make if you find you are unhappy in your department. There are many properties within the company which is a benefit if you ever plan on moving far away. There is a 401k (pro) but they only match up to a few hundred per year (con). There is paid time off (pro) but in the largest departments they are very poor at scheduling accurately (con) so even on days that have dozens of extra people you cannot actually get the time off (con) but sometimes you can get to work and they'll just ask you if you want to go home right away with zero hours work (not pro or con - just sloppy, stupid, and not very considerate) There are points called reward points that can be accumulated through the entire property doing well or you personally getting noticed for something. In a department of 20 people they work great. In a different department of 300 or 500 people they are basically useless at an individual level. If the property does succeed overall in any given quarter or year though there are lots of delightful prizes you can choose or let your points accumulate and score some really big great prizes. The people you work with in your own department at your own level are frequently a joy to work with (pro)
cons: There is no work-life balance. At least at the start expect to work (in almost any department other than HR) every holiday and mostly weekends as it is the busiest time.  It does not matter if your child is sick, you yourself are graduating college, you were in a car accident on the way to work or it's just sunny out and you don't want to come to work. They are so worried about being fair and equal that they are everything but considerate. You accumulate points towards getting fired at DOUBLE the regular daily rate if you are scheduled to work and do not show up but you do not get any extra pay - just your regular hourly wage. You also can only lose those points by time passing. If asked to stay over and you do, you can expect a thank you and a miniscule amount of reward credits. (See pros for explanation of reward credits) If you volunteer for overtime on a day they feel they need extra people you also do not get points removed. It's very one sided. Double trouble for high business days but no extra rewards. If you are in table games department you even have more days than other departments to which these rules apply. The customers satisfaction is valued way over the employees needs, feelings, or legitimate complaints. If you cross a person who plays more money in 15 minutes than you make in 5 years you can assume that anything they feel will be taken as fact even if security tape could back you up as correct. If however you are accused of anything even minor and are asked to sign an acknowledgement, you will not be able to have the security tape as your defense as they will not show it to you. Yes, they have been acknowledged as a Best Place to Work in Indiana but if you go to the website you'll find not all companies are considered, only those who are nominated or nominate themselves, and those companies willing to PAY to be evaluated for the title.] =",good,bad,excellent

[pros: - They've got funding
- There are plenty of really smart, hungry people to work with
- The Operations team puts on a really good facade for the company as a whole because they run a tight ship. The interview process, for example, is mature for a tech startup. It's not anywhere near what bigger companies do, but it's definitely admirable.
- Their content creation is on point because they need it to drive revenue
- Whether you like it or not, they have tight control over the culture of the workplace
cons: - C-suite leadership is out of touch. If you like being ignored as you say good morning or hello in the hallways, this is the place for you! 
- Do no expect work-life balance. In fact, leadership believes that while work-life balance is important, they want folks who are looking to ""build something meaningful."" AKA no consideration for work-life balance. If you interview here, do not mention work-life balance. It counts against you.
- It kills me to see hard-working, under-paid co-workers put in 60-80 hour weeks
- the product is very mediocre. Yes, they've elevated an outdated system to an app 
 and they've spun quite a tale with review sites, but the constant breakdowns and technical debt requires a serious overhaul. 
- you might read about certain feature capabilities on their site, but realize it is not quite there yet, which can be devastating to customers who really depend on specific features. 
- no real career advancement or professional development opportunities - they'll make up ad hoc responsibilities but not quite at the level of what could be meaningful enough for future employers
- lack of racial diversity; the team is mainly comprised of East Asian and White people. There is no effort at all to address this.
- On the point of racial diversity, the CEO put out a weak statement regarding the protests, and even equivocated the struggle of Black and Brown people to the ""struggle"" of folks whose neighborhoods were ""destroyed"" despite them working from home. I have a feeling they don't want to upset their strongly conservative customer base.
- tone-deaf conversations abound here all the time
- lack of quality benefits/perks: no 401k matching, only 1 catered lunch (which is actually just another meeting they pressure you to attend), and, if you don't know already, unlimited PTO is just another way to avoid paying any unused timed off. 
- It is the Stepford Wives here. If you do not support the idea that this place is the nearly perfect place they claim to be, you will be perceived very negatively. 
- Many of the reviews here are written by new hires in the honeymoon phase. It's a painfully skewed perspective that is unfair to prospective hires.
- Favoritism: feedback is inconsistently given to different people and career advancement is only provided to a very select group of people

Listen, all of this is not unique to UpKeep. That does not mean they should be exempt from critical feedback. I genuinely hope they develop a better vision for their employees because they deserve it.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: I think the training modules are excellent and certainly cover everything a CSR needs to know about the organization and their jobs. I have the added benefit of working with some great colleagues who are friendly and supportive. Management for the most part has also been considerate and helpful in making sure that everything is going alright. Certainly learn a lot on the job and become more knowledgeable and skillful because of it.

The benefits available are great and certainly worth while whether you are P/T or F/T. My branch makes everyone feel like part of the team with episodic events and get togethers. The managers' doors are always open which is good when problems arise.

I find the work that we do is gratifying because even when are selling services, they are at the benefit of the customer. It is just tough to do when they are in a rush and just want to deposit a cheque or cash. Regardless, it is a great feeling being able to help a customer enhance their portfolio and to be considered a hub of information for any questions that may be asked.
cons: Sales, sales, sales. It comes with the territory and that's fine. What's not fine is how you lose sales points if someone cancels a service that you signed them up for. It doesn't matter if another teller cancels it for the customer, you will lose the sales. Some people naturally are stronger at sales then others but TD puts way too much of an emphasis on sales and referrals without taking into consideration employees have different hours and capabilities. It also does not help when you reach one sales quarter, they then increase your sales goals by 6x its previous amount and then cut your hours by 1/3. Getting 3 hour shifts when it is really busy doesn't help any. I believe it is  unethical to post everybody's sales goals for everyone else to see. This should only be visible to the individual CSR and the management. It is also unjust to open the e-mail and see the people doing well (in green font) to people doing okay (in yellow font) and then the people doing poorly (in red BIG font). If that's suppose to be a form of motivation, then they fail in that regard as well. Branches overall suffer because of poor sales goals and then management is dumped on by superiors who then dump on CSRs. 

The other area of concern is checking for satisfaction. You need to get the highest level of satisfaction. Does not matter if people are very satisfied, they need to be extremely satisfied. This isn't an impossible thing to accomplish as I have done it a couple of times. The problem is when things are beyond the branch's control such as a shortage of staff and long lines. When a customer is called and queried about their experience, they may say something about the lines being too long and whichever teller was dealing with them  could get an unsatisfactory even though it was from something beyond their control. My branch is notorious for being short staffed but with the excellent people we have behind the wickets, we certainly hold down the fort as best as we can. Of course customers could be extremely satisfied based on something less relevant like the branch having nice decorations so it does go both ways.] =",bad,neutral,excellent

[pros: Robert Half has truly turned me into a consummate professional. This is a place where if you work hard and stay positive you can make wonderful living for yourself. As it is in any sales organization the first year  will require hard work and dedication as you build your book of business. The management and leadership team work extremely hard to ensure each new employee is given the tools and training to establish themselves in that first year. The reward after that first year though is six figure income potential and the satisfaction of knowing you are helping good, hard working people find better job opportunities. Once established there is also tremendous opportunity to look at new positions within the company. This is actually highly encouraged by RH leadership. The goal is to get employees into the type of  roles where they will be most happy/successful. Robert Half is the gold standard of the staffing industry and working here has been rewarding on so many levels. I feel I owe a great debt of gratitude to Robert Half for making me the professional I am today.
cons: The staffing industry as a whole is highly competitive, there certainly are challenges that come along working in such a competitive industry, especially in the beginning. The reward is absolutely worth the effort though. There can also be parody from manager to manager. Each new prospect will interview with the manager who will be overseeing them.

[pros: I went from Big 4 to FTI and there are definite benefits to a smaller, more analytical firm. The work we're doing is more rigorous and I'm more confident in it and you have better access to senior leadership. Pretty much everyone here Senior Director and below has been great - personable, not overly competitive, smart, and hard-working. Leaders have been engaged and respectful on projects and have taken an active interest in getting to know and developing junior team members. FTI has much more of a team mentality than other firms I've been exposed to.
cons: It's consulting - long hours and poor work-life balance with the expectation that you pay your dues and are always available to work. Slow adoption of technology that would make the job easier.

Upper management has little use for field technical support, yet brags that this is their trademark approach to supporting customers.

[pros: There was really nothing at all good or nice about working here. It was horrible.
cons: When you first start here, it seems nicer enough.  But then, there is something about the culture that makes people turn on each other.  This is because, whatever goes wrong, it is always someones fault and the high up managers lead with fear and micro management.  This soon results in a depressing, stressful and unhelpful workplace.

I was scared every day that I was there, Scared of doing any one single thing wrong, which would be blown out of all proportion.  I can only describe it as feeling like being back at school.  The daily fear soon gets to people and the offices have had a lot of staff come and go.  As much as the the senior managers say they are bothered, they never ever deal with why so many office staff have walked out of their jobs.  This needed to be looked at before more people quit.  The senior managers are the most fake I've ever worked with - pretend to be bothered and then always go against what they said, and did not make any changes to the level of stress.  There are plenty of places to work in the area, this place should be a very last resort.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

If you file complaints the bosses will just tell the corrupt leadership what you said. Hardworking people are not acknowledged or rewarded while those who really know nothing are getting applauded left and right. Run, don't walk from this job.

cons: Poor management in our call center.  Likes to micro-manage a lot, breathing down your neck, literally treating you like you're still new when they know you've been around for over ten years!  Been with the company for exactly 12 years and last four  years the company has been pushing us as call center reps for more to do with little time forgetting that we're not robots.

Having a good relationship with my coworkers makes going to work fun because it's like getting to spend the day with my friends. The managers are also amazing. They plan group outings, they're also basically like our friends and they're always there for us.
cons: The hours we get are based on the amount of sales we get. Therefore on a regular basis when the sales are average, we don't get much hours. Whereas in the summer or during the holiday season, we get tons of hours and sometime we can get overtime if we want. But most of the time that's not the case. Also when it's busy during summer or the holidays, we work extra hard to deal with customers and keep the store clean. We also sometimes have to do floorset shifts which are overnight therefore they're hard and tiring. The last con would be the pay. It's a minimum wage job and rarely do we get a raise.] =",neutral,good,excellent

If working for a major global news organization is your goal, you could do far worse.
cons: The work is 24/7/365. It's like being on a treadmill that's constantly speeding up as you run. Management is trying to adapt to the new media environment and thinks the answer is to squeeze more out of the existing staff.

[pros: Free lunch, free sodas. Good for contractors. Used to be very good place to learn new technology.
cons: The workload has increased since the company was sold to a private investor a year ago. The new owner is outsourcing the IT organization to India, as much as possible, while business is not growing. The management team is a tight clique. They are caring more about their own rewards and promotions than anything else. For example bonuses are only for management, progressively higher with rank, on top of already higher base pay. But management is also territorial with each other. There is not much collaboration, but more and more politics and blaming. I think the company culture is backward. It favors a top-down hierarchy of the type of "" the highest paid person in the room is always right"".  Not surprisingly the employee turnover is ridiculous, just about everybody is thinking about leaving. The many negative reviews here only show the tip of the iceberg, with the occasional rebuttals by HR or the folks who feel criticized  just providing more evidence of the situation.

The CEO is blind to the goings on in her organization. I was told I will be put on furlough as a non essential employee when the next nurse strike occurs.

The working environment is very collaborative, allowing for a lot of creative thinking. 

Great benefits, generous compensation, and flexible time off policy all pluses.  Free lunch on Friday's, and other common tech industry perks.

I think LivePerson is also uniquely positioned in the market as being at the right place at the right time.

I see a lot of future opportunity.
cons: LivePerson's culture and working environment isn't for everyone.  If you're someone that needs clear instruction and everything handed to you in order to move a project forward, this isn't the place for you.  I personally find this as a pro as it enables a lot of creative latitude, so if you like figuring things out and finding your own path, this is a company you will thrive at.

The open floor plan only has a few benefits. No privacy or anywhere to go if you have a bad day. I got sick more there than any other job I had previously.

[pros: If you are one of the chosen ones you will have some opportunities until you fall out of favor
cons: Very toxic environment for both management and agreement employees. There is no job stability with this company. Employees live in constant fear of being laid off/let go with no warning. Cuts are made by executive leadership without input from direct supervisors or teams. 
The company is paying lip service to wanting to hire more females and diverse candidates, but puts no effort into developing or promoting the current female and diverse employees.
Promotional/Growth opportunities are extremely limited. Upper level management is shuffled from department to department, and they bring their favorites with them. It's unfortunate that employees with departmental experience aren't even able to apply for promotional opportunities because an executive will make the ""business decision"" to bring someone with no experience over from a different department without even posting the position.

The team in Cluj makes the model codes, adds it into the system and does the documentation.

[pros: You have good Resting rooms, one can nap for some time when you’re sick /need.
You can login from home ,if you have system at home but no laptops when I worked.
cons: When I was working the total project knowledge is know by a single resource.  No proper Documentation to even go through or have self training.
No proper KT is arranged by the new manager who was appointed to handle multiple projects in which was included the one I am working. The manager is completely non technical unable to understand minimum technical terminology like SIT/Dev env and highly dependent on the single resource who has the project details who had been quite some time in the project. 
The work environment is so bad that the single resource has the ability to bad mouth /yelling the new comers and can do whatever he can. Manager has nothing to do with. when they are recruiting they did not even mention that it is a L3 support project and which made my stay more difficult since we need to support the release during weekend .Manger forced me to come on weekends despite my request several times not to do that. Also there is lot of support and appreciation given to vendor resources in the project. All I can observe is Manager and the single resource had placed lot of pressure on me so that I would be leaving the project and they want to replace my place with some new vendor resource.Finally I have resigned and then I got in touch with HR during exit interview and explained the situations which made me to do so.
I was really shocked to see the working environment in BACCI so pathetic which is quite different from the projection I saw outside. So was placing this review to help other new joiners to be careful .] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: Pay is great, there are some awsome benefits at Nike. Tons of discounts on all kinds of merchandise. The benefits are the best of any retail company operating in the us today.

Great place for people with lots of energy and the time to invest in a great job. The best benefit fo rme is the tuition reimbursement. I am going to college for free.
cons: A lot of hours are required of managers. At time some weeks will require you give up your scheduled days off. Nike district managers and even corporate partners like vice presidents visit stores on monthly and yearly basis. During this time you will have to work everyday and have the store in perfect shape for the visit. This is time in appreciated and lots of thanks and recognition is given.

[pros: - I had the opportunity to be one of the first employees in Uber in LATAM. It's been amazing  to see how fast it has grown and all the potential we still have. Back in the days (July 2014) we were operating with Rides in 7 cities in the region, and we are now in more than 130. We now have UberEats too, expanding rapidly.
- I haven't had the chance to get bored in almost 4 years. New projects and challenges coming up every day.
- I've also had the opportunity to grow, start hiring and build a team
- It is very goal and objectives driven. You are set up with tasks and goals, and you are free to do whatever you think is best - but making sure to deliver!
- They trust you and will help you along the way
- I'ts been truly inspiring to see how Uber has changed from inside out, changing its mission, priorities, etc,  but always listening to employees and doing what's best for them
- I'm confident we are heading to an even better place.. and still with plenty of challenges ahead
cons: - The fast growth was also a bit painful. Constant changes, switch of priorities every time and we didn't really got to plan anything, just react and deliver.
-  Its very hard to be in a company so publicly known, where you see negative news almost every day... most of the times these are not entirely true. 
- As we grew so fast, we tried to grow our people very fast too. We got to a point where we had lots of young managers - that were first time managers.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

[pros: When I think of a ""pro"" - if I ever do- I will share it.
cons: It was the most horrible experience of my life.  I needed work pretty badly. I had had a divorce, and had to move - this affected me being hired, so I really needed work. They promised they wanted my foreign language skills (which are good), and Customer Service - I would be a cashier.  They did say there would be a LITTLE physical work - but not much - very minor.  They took me up to 12,000 feet in altitude, and had me carry boxes up and down stairs until my left side went completely numb and I got very sick - 3 days in a row.  They treated me very badly for it - like a child (I am 59 years old, so of course it angered me), and then 3 managers berated me for about 1/2 hour - I cried hard because they were so cruel.  They fired me - since I had room/ board this meant I now had no place to stay.  They said ""what is that to us?"" They were completely cruel and awful.  I got off their premises with some help - they never processed me as an employee, so I will get no pay for the 3 days I worked until I dropped.  I have never been treated so badly in my life - their pay wasn't very high anyway.  It certainly was not worth the abuse.  I risked everything just to get a job.  I was sick, and after they upset me badly with 1/2 hour of berating, I had to call an ambulance for a ""killer""headache.  My blood pressure was 260/168, and since my left side had gone numb, the Emergency room feared I'd had a stroke.  They determined I did not - but they did say nobody should be sent to 12,000 feet in altitude without acclimitization because it can kill you.  Once I left them, with no place to go, the people I spoke to in Colorado were also horrible to me, and no help was available except help that was too hard for me, physically.  I ended up trusting somebody I should not - going to another state - and now I'm extricating myself from the problems that the person I had to turn to, has caused.  I am still not ok - thanks to Xanterrible (no thanks).  This place is so terrible - I do not recommend them, especially if you really need a job!

-dispatcher would often create routes that make you work beyond your time consistently.

- not open Sundays. A benefit to some, but it's not a Mon-Fri business. Which means some people will have split days off. If it was a business open 7-days a week then everyone can 2 days off rather than a split.
It creates difficulties for personal life.

[pros: about the easiest fast food job you can have, menu is easy to learn, my coworkers are easy to get along with, easy to get hours and overtime if you need it, and our RGM and area coach know what they're doing and they have good values. lots of opportunities to grow, and it is overall a pretty fun job.
cons: crew members sort of get shafted when it comes to pay considering how much work they do, and we've had a few managers that get away with not helping out their crew when they need it (there was a time when i closed with just one of the managers and they expected me to do all of the closing responsibilities myself and still get us out of there at a reasonable hour, honestly pathetic). no benefits whatsoever for crew, but they're not completely out of the picture because you can earn these if you move up. no vacation time whatsoever, and hardly any sick days, which is to be expected with fast food.] =",bad,good,bad

cons: Company doesn't care about employees all they care about is making money. Only a certain amount of full-time positions available (in the stores near me no more than 6 but depends on the volume of the store).

[pros: Working at SNC-Lavalin gave me great insight into the world of consulting, and I gained some hard skills from them like report writing, proposal writing, field work, lab work, etc. However, I think that you could get these skills working for any of the competitors. The real strength was the people employed at my location. They were what kept me there. I found myself in a lot of stressful situations, which I actually look at now as a pro, due to my stepping up in the conflict resolution department and learning to stand up for myself. The ethics hotline is great, and the yearly reviews are very helpful- they also contribute to relationship development between department heads and team members.
cons: This company does a poor job of showing its employees that they are valued. Communication between management and department heads / regular employees, as well as upper management and the various branches is not a strong point. When i found myself looking for support, my immediate HR representative did a great job, but above that, things were disappointing. There are far too many middle men in the administration and finance departments, which complicates things for the billable employees trying to do their jobs.] =",excellent,neutral,terrible

[pros: Management seems to respect work/life balance, and recognize the aging of their workforce. They're currently one of the most financially stable employers (given the current economic climate), but are known for mass layoffs on occasion. If you're a lazy person, the corporation seems to tolerate your doing the bare minimum, find a place for you, and allow you to remain as long as you don't bother anyone else. The benefits package seems pretty good.
cons: Don't do it! If you're young, bright, energetic, want to take risks and do really cool work without being bogged down with horribly burdensome amounts of process and paperwork, go somewhere else if you can help it.  The organization moves slowly in terms of technology and its people - it's top heavy, and loathe to get rid of dead wood within the company. You WILL wade through several layers of documentation and authority to complete any task, and you WILL encounter resistance when trying to streamline operations. Don't expect to be creative in your job, either - as a result of the fore-mentioned paperwork, this company runs on legacy systems and knowledge and hardly tolerates change.

Expect a lot of classically apathetic employees who are 50+ years old going through the motions of their work, and a smaller number of people who are < 30 doing the same thing (they tend to go elsewhere after a couple of years, and with good reason). The exceptions to these demographics are a rapidly ascending small group of middle managers to fill the gap, and possibly the most unnerving group of young corporate climbers in the technical leadership programs. (Anecdotally, most participants are from lower tier schools - but to be fair, they're simply indicative of the value placed on interpersonal skills that fit the company culture over raw technical ability. That's well within the corporation's prerogative, and it's obviously a mutually beneficial relationship.) The young corporate climbers might not be unique to the company; but be sure you can buy into its culture before joining LM.

I'm modifying my original statement. If you're young and energetic, LM might be the place for you, because with those qualities it should be easy to stand out. This is doubly true if you're a minority - you will see no one will looks like you in executive leadership (even more on the downside, you might get a lot of the old guard commenting on your ""diversity"" status; this has actually happened to me on several occasions). If your priorities lie more in line with doing actual engineering work, being able to concentrate on doing it well with other talented folks and being surrounded by people who feel the same way, go someplace else. Essentially, this company relies on stale processes and systems rather than on true innovation and efficiency.] =",bad,bad,excellent

[pros: It was close to home
cons: They lied and told me I would get 20-25 hours per week when I interviewed. I was hired as a part time operations manager. They said they could only pay me $10 an hour and my hours were never stable. One week I had 17 hours, One week it was less than 14 hours. Then, 19.5 hours... then 22, then 16 . There is only one cashier and one manager scheduled at a time. So even though I should have been able to take a break (and was told to clock out for one) I was still required to work through my “break” ringing as back up, providing change, doing bill checks, entering my manager # at the register for exchanges, quantities, and price adjustments & helping customers who wanted me to call other dollar trees for them, walk them over to isles to find things, check in the back for things... the list goes on. Before I knew it, my “break” was over. The store was constantly trashed because there simply isn’t enough employees to keep on top of all the work. I was coming in nightly and straightening ridiculous messes, damaging out broken/stolen items with packaging left behind, putting things back in the correct isles, only to find it was even worse the following day. There is a “go back station” where damages, and items left in the wrong isles are placed for sorting, going back out on the floor, or disposing of. This station was a nightmare always. all of the baskets would be full, 2-3 shopping carts over flowing, plus baskets on the floor, and cardboard boxes full of stuff. You could barely walk back there without tripping. The other managers were lazy and would leave spoiled food they found — such as thawed frozen fish, rotten blocks of cheese, thawed frozen asparagus, leaking milk, and they’d just pile more damages on top of it until the whole area smelled horrible. I was damaging out items one night, and the putrid juice from the thawed out items leaked on me. It smelled disgusting. The workload they expect from you in the limited amount of hours they’re willing to provide you, along with the laughable pay that couldn’t even fund a high schoolers weekend mall trips made this the worst job I ever had. You are entrusted with so much and you are paid garbage, treated like a workhorse, and if another manager doesn’t feel like coming in, you are scheduled at their will— especially on weekends. I literally worked every single weekend Friday-Sunday  at one point and when I asked for at least one set day off on the weekend, they threatened to fire me altogether.

[pros: Great discounts. As an employee, you get 50% off menu prices. 
The laid back atmosphere makes coming to work fun.
cons: Personally, my managers were very unorganized and I'm pretty sure they lacked the qualifications to manage a business. Scheduling was their weakest point. One manager would schedule FOH on one day while the other manager would schedule BOH the next. Instead of hiring people or writing up a logical schedule to maximize the use of their employees, the managers would give their favorite employees tons of hours, even if it meant someone receiving 60+ hours a week. If you weren't in the clique, you didn't get hours. This doesn't mean you were a bad employee, necessarily.

[pros: Quality products and a high level of caring by the lower level staff that actually produces and supports the products. The company cares greatly about client satisfaction. Everyday employees take great pride in what they are developing and rolling out to customers. The former A4  portion of the company is a close knit team that treats each other like family.
cons: Continuous push from upper management to work harder and faster within ever tightening and often unrealistic schedules. This is becoming the norm instead of the exception. Employee morale is decreasing as the message getting out to employees is ""what you have done is still not good enough. Do more. Faster. But make sure it is just as good."" And it is to be done with inadequate amounts of resources. Employees that were previously treated as integral parts of the company are now treated as numbers. 

Projects are planned by ""running numbers"" and people are reviewed by ""running numbers"" instead of TALKING to people to see what the real needs and challenges are for projects.

Some people are managing areas that are not really appropriate and are making bad decisions for the company. This hurts everyone. Their plans and ideas are not to be questioned.

The culture also seems to be one of ""taking things away"" from employees...things that used to mitigate the low salaries.] =",bad,bad,excellent

[pros: They pretended to give me a chance and acted like they acknowledged my potential for a bit.
cons: Let me start off by saying, I was an acquired employee. Usually, when you inherit something from someone else, you are supposed to have a neutral view on it and accept it with open arms. When Dunbar was acquired by Brinks, I was one of the few, if not one of the only, who did not constantly complain out of spite. I didn't bash the new culture, the company, the employees. I went along with everything with an open mind. I thought that alone would make me stand out from the rest, nevermind my multiple years of experience in my job. Without getting too personal, the acquisition came at a bad time, not that they ever come at a good one. An immediate family member of mine was battling a terminal illness, and I was the primary caregiver. My attitude and approach to work was just as vivacious as ever, and I made every effort to work remotely and be available at all times, despite caring for an immensely sick loved one. When the sale was made official, we were practically in the clear. Things were looking up. No one needed to know that, because it was my personal business, but my supervisor frequently asked how my family member was doing, which I found odd because he was never one for small talk or caring any bit about my life outside of work.

As time went on, I was treated very poorly and negatively by my fellow Brinks colleagues. Although I had an open minded approach to working for Brinks, it was obvious that the more seasoned employees there saw me as a threat. They were downright rude. Still, I continued to work there. The morale amongst former Dunbar employees faded and faded, until it was at an all time low. Around this time, my supervisor stopped answering my calls. When I say stopped answering, I don't mean he took a long time to respond. I mean he flat-out ignored me on and off for months. This all culminated to my getting let go with no notice at all.

While a part of me will always wish that this company could have seen me for my true potential and actually valued my skill set, I realize that what happened to me is not my fault, and it is their loss, not mine. I don't miss any of it, from the poor communication to the low morale, to being ignored, to being treated so low that I dreaded coming to work every day. That being said, I don't know if I will ever forgive. There is a piece of me, a very prominent piece, that tried so very hard to appease these people, so hard that it was dominating my life, especially at a time when I should have been focusing on my loved one. I can't get that time back, but I can reflect that that's the life this company expects from you. I don't consider it coincidental at all that they found me no longer useful as soon as they found out my family member was healthy again.

As with any review I leave, my experience is here for you as a tool. Take it or leave it, and make your own decision. I am sure there are people at this company who have had a great experience. Read this review along with others and make your best judgment call.] =",terrible,terrible,none

[pros: The only things are that you work 5 days a week and have insurance. The pay is ok but you really have to cheat the customers to make real good money

[pros: I joined the old Nalco Refinery Process Services in 1979 as a Tech Rep in Beaumont, TX.  Over the years I was handed raises and promotions regularly without asking.  I peaked as the Energy Services (general) Marketing Manager in Asia.  In late 2012 took a fall, hit my head and became seriously disabled.  The disability pay included my best year's commissions in their calculation of the 70% entitlement plus picking up virtually all the massive medical costs.  Hard to beat.
cons: I had a wonderful 30+ years, met some life long friends, got travel through most of the US, Europe and Asia and made a good bundle of cash for my retirement when the time comes.  The only negative I imagine is the crowding cause by the mergers with Ecolab and Champion.

[pros: They are very flexible if you are a part-timer, especially since I was in high school. It was a good place to start off.
cons: The number of hours you worked depended on how long you've been with the company, plus your availability. Some part-timers got around 20 hours a week while others got 4 or 8. The store I worked at hired very many part-time employees so turnover was very high.

[pros: The people, on the whole, are great and always have been.  The majority of people really care and want the best for their colleagues, customers and the company as a whole.

After a couple of years of what would probably best described as austerity within Sage, we have started to reinvest and put faith in it people and we are starting to reap the benefits.

One of the company's main focus' at the moment is colleague success, also has a great focus on staff lead innovation and continuous improvement.
cons: Complicated and hidden salary structure and bonus schemes (bonus schemes brought more inline for FY19 but there are lots of schemes across various departments).  

It doesn't pay as well as other companies for comparable roles but does have a good benefits package.

Target on AHT (or calls per hour) this should be an indicator but not a target.

More investment in product development needed.

Annual pay increases not in line with inflation.

Moving offices which will have a detrimental effect (time and money) on a lot of people, this is supposed to be being discussed at an individual level but I am not aware that anyone's concerns have been assessed.] =",good,good,excellent

cons: Bonus used as a carrot to entice you to go the extra mile and before you know it you worked an 80 hr week for a year just to stay afloat.

[pros: There are many employees of different ages and ethnicities so it is very socially interesting to learn about other cultures, make friends and integrate. Most are students. The work is very simple and you learn quickly. They give you all the necessary equipment to carry out the tasks and generally your colleagues are friendly and willing to help you.
cons: Both managers and the human resources team do not interact with lower-ranking employees, only with supervisors because what they demand jobs and tasks that they themselves do not know how to do. They don't treat you as a person, they don't care, they don't have empathy or social skills. You only have direct contact with your colleagues and supervisors but if you have a problem or are ill you should go to the managers. The work is physically exhausting since you do the same for 5 to 8 hours at a time and it is monotonous but achievable and the good work environment (colleagues and supervisors) helps to pass the hours. On paper there are several benefits such as courses and extra learning but to achieve them you need the authorization of the managers and once again I repeat, they are not interested in the employees.] =",neutral,neutral,excellent

[pros: Competitive base pay (hourly, not salaried), hybrid work environment, diverse group of reps that support and help each other, and a generous PTO plan.
cons: Upper management consistently makes decisions that make target difficult to acheive or create a negative work environment. We are never provided with clear answers on these decisions or other changes. During team meetings, upper managment will often interrupt and talk over employees trying to voice their concerns. Upper management has no accountability and shifts blame for decisions up the ladder, attributing changes to corporate, or purely feigns ignorance. Commission plans for reps were changed to offer less compensation to any rep under target, and then the same month all teams went through a challenging tech migration. Since that month, upper managment has mput into place several more decisions that make target achievement more difficult without concern for or input of employees. Upper management uses a severe micromanaging style. Management will make massive changes that drastically affect workflow and target achievement and will not notify teams of these changes until the moment they go into effect. Reps are threatened with corrective action if they make a mistake regarding these changes in processes despite them being sprung on us without warning. We were told this corrective action would come with threat of termination if repeated, and would leave a mark on our employment record for 30-60 days. We later learned that this was a lie and the mark is permanent. There are often miscommunications between management that result in such false promises and misinformation.

[pros: Great Benefits- Medical benefits are really good and extremely affordable. Tuition re-imbursement is nice too. ThermoFisher promotes growth and movement within the company.
cons: Lack of site leadership. It has taken months now to find our new Site Manager, which is very concerning. No reward for working long hard hours. Very low pay for all the work we have to do. Micromanagement within several departments, especially business/project management. No flexibility with work from home. The only care and push seen at the site is all for revenue. No one cares how its done to get there, which is a huge issue because you now take a hit on quality. NO training department or good training. The site does not understand that in order to ensure that all employees (Operators and new hires especially) can perform the job correctly, you need some sort of formal training in place. You are just thrown into the wolves at this site to hope you figure it out on your own. The site as a whole is depressing.

[pros: Generally, personnel on the Mobile Accessories Team were pleasant enough to work with; competitive salary, respectable benefits, centralized office location is great for suburban commuters.
cons: The team is managed through an authoritative mindset that stifles new talent out of the gates. Team members are rarely empowered with decision-making and are highly micro-managed. When they do venture to make an independent decision, they are habitually overturned and discounted. 

This, over very short time, leads to downtrodden, unconfident employees who are dependent on guidance and approval and end up with little more ability than to do precisely what they are instructed. This employee deterioration also attributes to the unavoidable erosion of any collaborative trust network that is essential to team– and incredibly high turnover. 

During my one year of employment, I was the ninth person to leave the MA team. And, from what I learned during that time, 19 people proactively chose to leave the team within the last three years. That fact alone should speak volumes about what it’s really like to work on the MA team at Fellowes. We can’t all be disgruntled employees with poor performance and bad work ethic. We can’t all be written off as ineffective. We were all once hired because of what we hoped we could bring to the table – skills, talents, insights and unique experiences to be put to good use if given genuine opportunity.

Finally, I can’t even fathom what this turnover attributes to from a financial perspective with regard to training and re-training staff, crippling any forward momentum and team morale. I did often overhear teammate complaints about the turnover in MA marketing and the rude reality of surviving the learning curve of yet another new person getting up-to-speed because of the lack of process documentation and role longevity.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

I can say the same for the benefits as well.
cons: - Good old boys club in some areas - Competitive environment hurts more than it helps - Lack of sponsorship for growth - Poor incentivizing does not result in good behavior - It's hard to get a promotion even when you're already doing the work and exceed the years of experience required. - Your time on the team could impact your performance review - It feels as though their using your age to decide whether or not to promote you] =",bad,good,excellent

[pros: Decent pay. $12.00/hour and all hours worked after 5 PM are paid out at $12.85/hour.  Nice team environment even though you're working from home. There was never a time where I felt that I was completely on my own. Someone was always available if I had a problem. They have a comprehensive paid training program that fully prepares you for the job you're going to do. You're required to upsell and there are specific metrics you're expected to meet, like average handle time for calls, etc. Your metrics are easy to meet as long as you show up.
cons: No commission for sales which a kind of a bummer since I'm really good at sales. You're required to start on an afternoon shift and work weekends. Shift bids occur occasionally but it's difficult to get chosen among all the people who bid for that shift. I had a really cool supervisor but she didn't do her job and was never there when anyone needed her. She would promise to schedule performance review meetings with me and then never followed through. During my 90 day ""nesting period"" I was supposed to have one meeting a week with her but only had 4 meetings during that time.] =",bad,neutral,bad

[pros: decent market, everyone/every business needs paint, job security
cons: I was with the company for 5 years and consider myself a good 'ole boy. I tried to apply outside of my district to be near the girlfriend for going on 4 years (and soon later to be my fiancé), however I was never given the opportunity to even be in the MTP (Management Training Program). I graduated college in December of 2016, despite my years of experience within the company and my degree, the job was given to a new hire directly out of college with hardly any previous work experience. Going into this company, I thought the company would respect the employees that have tenure and have stuck with them for a while, more so than a random out of company applicant. Come to find out, the hired associate had connections to the district manager somehow, proving to me that it really is who you know, not what you know. 
If you like having your weekends, this is not the place for you. You will work almost every other week AT LEAST, until you get to manage a store of your own (a feat that again, you will not get unless you know someone higher up than the store manager level). I do not recommend this job to anyone who is looking. They sucker you in with decent pay, but I promise a few grand less and no weekend work is the way to go. I have multiple friends that have either quit and/or are looking for another job, ones that are assistant managers, even a few that are managers.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: At my East coast location in Florida, the great water view from the tower building was the best part of the job.
cons: The boss never came to work before 10:30 am. Often Noon. He'd ride his bike to work. Shower in the bldg gym. Come into the office in sweaty biking clothes he put back on. Stay abt 1 hr. Go to lunch with his wife. Return to office to chat 99% non-business. Leave abt 4:00.
He also seriously discriminated against me for my hearing disability. Blatant put downs. The boss and another co-worker would talk over 2 partitions while I was on the phone with prospects or clients. These people could hear them too. So unprofessional. After abt 5 times being told I'd have to get used to the noise, and my explaining I literally am Legally Deaf with hearing aids, he finally set up a card table and a metal fold up chair for me in a vacant ofc with his bike in it, no pictures or decor. I declined. Finally, he e-mailed me the same. I forwarded it to the VP of HR. She acted immediately. I was issued high quality headphones. Talk abt breaking laws. That manager did it. Next 2 managers and the VP then Happily agreed that I'd work Remotely under an exceptional female success story Manager in Riverview, California. At the last day, the owner of this 40 yr company sold the company, stopped my mgr transfer, and 2 weeks later I was downsized out by new company. Of course! I reported a blatant & repeated violation by that 1st manager re my 65% Deaf with hearing aids. It guaranteed my exit from the company during the company. Horrid experience. Truly Horrid derogatory talk at me.

[pros: Coverall gives the tools and training (Master Franchise NGT) needed to succeed.  Compensation and Benefits were very competitive and good.  Because Coverall is a Franchise Cleaning Service, learning to work with Franchisee's as a Business Partner and not an employee is very eye opening and rewarding as you have the opportunity to not only progress your personal career, but you help impact the businesses of local Franchisee's.

Coverall (Master Franchise NGT) also provided me with top notch sales training, that can and will be used in any industry going forward.  Year after year, Coverall wins ""Stevie Awards"" which is awarded to Companies that show exemplary business support to their Franchisee's.
cons: There are only 2 cons I can think of:

1.  Some offices are not fully staffed, leaving the remaining employees to pick up the slack.  Wonderful for the Owners and Managers, as the Billing per Employee is higher as a ratio.  Not so great if your compensation is based on retention, and there are not enough employees to maintain acceptable account retention.

2.  Actual cleaning crews are not employees of Coverall, but Franchisee's.  This was also listed as a Pro because it does have valuable aspects to it.  However, in the rare event that a Franchisee is not performing to their required capabilities, it is not as easy as dealing with an employee who is not doing their job.  Because the Franchisee is their own business owner, they do not work for you, and is sometimes a challenge to manage due to the business relationship.  This can be solved and overcome by working with the Franchisee and re-training.  This Con can easily be turned into a Pro, but it is sometimes an obstacle.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

Had some managers treat me as if I were their personal slave to. i.e. always had me empty the trash/clean the bathrooms, run errands for them as a seasonal hire. Overnight team was messy and did not clean up after themselves in the break room/bathroom. Management wanted you to put product that was overstock on the sales floor when there was no space for it. We had a janitor hired for both trash and bathroom cleaning/emptying, I don't mind doing either or but when you're doing it every day, & there is other associates there besides you there that are capable of doing the same task. That throws up a red flag. And yes I understand at times the janitor was late due to weather/traffic. But still there are other people that can do the same task of cleaning bathrooms and taking trash out.] =",terrible,bad,bad

cons: Managers expecting you to sell the retail merchandise, thats the only way you get hours. Its like your hours are based on your sales, push store items to the people that are coming from eating their meal. I myself dont really like it when im shopping & someone is following me asking me all kinds of questions. They expect you to walk around following the customers, also, how are you supposed to sell the products in the retail store when you are still in training and only worked 4 days, I barely knew where everything was, much less what items were on sale and on clearance, etc. and I really wasn’t trained long enough to know about the merchandise.

[pros: profit sharing. if you know the right people you can advance.
cons: Employees are overworked, mistreated and disposable!
Overworked: Ideally most people want to work Mon–Fri with weekends off right? You will have to work weekends (either a Saturday or a Sunday, sometimes both). Whether you’ll work every, every other or 1 out of every 3 weekends will vary, but no one’s immune to working weekends. Currently GEICO’s Macon office forces employees to work 10 HOUR SHIFTS on the weekend (Sales department). When you work a Saturday or Sunday, you get a weekday off (8 hrs) the following week. As for the additional two hours, they break it up; you leave 30 minutes earlier for the rest of the week. How’s that fair? I’m forced work for 10 consecutive hours in one day, but you give me the additional time off in small increments? Not to mention you will rarely get two consecutive days off. If you’re forced to work on a Saturday, & off on Sunday, your 2nd day off will be: Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday (never a Monday or Friday). 
Abused: GEICO has also tricked employees into working overtime. They claimed that overtime became MANDATORY, & that every employee would have to work a minimum of 2 additional hours per week.  They would start by sending emails that would say please sign up for the mandatory over time, if you didn’t volunteer, a supervisor would come to your cubicle and force you to sign up. The number started increasing to a minimum of 5 hours per week. This went on for approximately 4 to 6 months before some employees complained to HR; we later found out that what they were doing was NOT LEGAL. 
Mistreated: First time I made GEICO’s Chairman’s club (My results for the year were in the top 10-15%). Every year the CEO visits, & gives an award to each associate that made Chairman's. The ceremony usually lasts a couple hours, and it’s supposed to increase employee morale by giving recognition. The particular date of the ceremony happened to also be my day off (from working the previous weekend). I asked MGMT, if they could switch which day I was off, so that I could attend. I was immediately told No, & if I wanted to attend that I would have to go on my own time. Yet, any employees regularly scheduled to work that day, were still being PAID while attending the ceremony. MGMT was also fully aware that I commuted over 60 miles one way to work, when they told me no. Hearing that was like throwing dirt in my face, I literally could not believe it. Why do you think treating employee's so badly, will motivate them to perform well for your company?
Disposable: The goals are ridiculous & every year they increase, to the point where they’re not even close to being attainable. Employees have approximately 5-7 goals, & each are worth a percentage to give you an overall score between 1 and 5 (1 being the worst, 5 being the best). Being in sales, I had a Sale per hour goal, & I had to confront my supervisor about receiving conflicting results/scores. For Ex: Month 1: I sale 200 policies, & my score would be a 2(below average). Month 2:  I only sale 160 policies, yet my score would be 3 (average). No one could explain to me how the result was actually calculated, so how exactly am I expected to improve? If you score at least a 3 on all of your goals for at least 3 months (consecutively), you are eligible for a raise, and a pay grade/scale increase. Yet they won't mention up front that your goals will get harder as your pay grade/scale increases. Once your results/scores start to slip below average (anything below 3) you will get put on a probation period. If your results haven’t improved by the end of probation, they may offer to move you to another department or FIRE you. Yes I did say fire; GEICO likes to state how they NEVER lay off employees. Well this is how they do it folks, they will make your goals unreachable, and if you don't quit from the stress, you can and will be fired. By doing it this way, they don't have to publish in the papers that they had to lay off. I've heard this straight from the horse’s mouth, as well as witnessed this happen to many colleagues.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Salesforce has several things going for it if viewed from the outside.
- They have a truly exceptional product which makes it easy to sell and believe in
- They offer an ESPP program which, considering the company's growth rate, is a very lucrative benefit for employees taking advantage of it
- Their benefits are above average; Health insurance, dental, vision, discounts from other companies (hotels, gyms, consumer goods, services), paid volunteer time off
- Plenty of training and self growth opportunities
- Supportive managers (with exception and to the best of their ability)
- CEO everything he makes himself out to be and more.  Truly the only reason Salesforce had a fighting chance in the beginning.
cons: Now that we have gone over some of the marginal benefits of working for Salesforce, lets spend some time reviewing the truly disappointing aspects that seem to be ignored when the poll for ""Best company to work for"" is taken:

1. Quotas are not based on past territory performance averages but are instead standardized across the board.  Compounding on this is the fact that territory assignments are completely based on need not performance.  This means that someone with Alabama as their territory must meet the same quota as someone with California or New York as their territory.  This creates resentment among reps and leads to many people leaving for better offers.  

2. Outdated school of thought around increasing revenue growth and productivity.  This may be obvious to some, but hiring people like Keith Block, who helped grow and create the very companies we at Salesforce are trying to bring change to, could only cause issues.  The most significant of which is their belief that increasing the number of activities increases their revenue growth by the same percentage increase.  This doesn't work. All it does is make employees resent management.  Keith, if you read this, look up ""Marginal Product of Labor"" and think about your current growth initiatives of mandating unachievable minimum activity levels for your employees.

3. Salesforce is currently paying their new hires more than their tenured sales dev reps.  Think about that.  How does a company claim to care about their employees yet pays well below the industry average and doesn't roll out pay increases to all employees in a department.  Benioff likes to talk about gender pay equality, but I know for a fact there are experienced women making less then inexperienced men in the same position.  This goes the same for the reverse.  What makes this even more upsetting is that they did not inform anyone of this.  The reps found out on their own.  Again, decreasing trust in management.

4. Stagnent internal growth.  They promise promotions in 12 months or less but in reality, they have created such a toxic work environment people are looking for ways out of sales dev slowing this process to 15 months or more.

5. Politics, politics, politics. For a company that claims to have that ""Start-Up"" feel, they seem to suffer from all the major issues you find at larger companies.  Management is run completely top down with zero confidence in others leading to low level managers being the bearers of bad news rather than mentors.

6. Below average compensation.  I won't say much more on this, but the starting salary here means you're living paycheck to paycheck in San Francisco.  

I could go on, but I think these give you an idea of the way the company is headed.  In case you were wondering, this decline in work environment began right around the same time Keith Block was brought on.  Interesting coincidence some would say.

All of this essentially leads to Salesforce creating one of the most sought after employees in the industry while simultaneously pushing them to the point that they would rather change companies than stay at the ""Best place to work"" in the Bay.] =",bad,terrible,excellent

[pros: Benefits are good. Trip to Denver. Nice office in Apopka, Fl. Pay is competitive.
cons: Such a MAJOR disappointment! I was fed lies in the beginning about the structure and direction of my role. Haven't had a manager since I've been employed here (almost a year now). Micromanagement is out of control!! Treated like an entry level rep rather than someone with over 8 years of experience in the IT Industry. Show up, falsify time reports, fake 20 calls and BS funnels and you are a TOP rep at this place....and management encourages this!!! Only favored reps get fed leads by management, everyone else gets treated poorly and performance questioned almost daily. Managers openly talk about employees behind their backs to other employees. I have personally overheard so many racist remarks being made that I will be reporting to HR. Trainers are beyond rude, and could care less if you really learn anything. Their primary concern is their agenda, and you are treated as if you will be fired if you don't pass their test's everyday.  I have never worked in such an unprofessional environment in my entire career. Anyone within an authoritative position (aside from a very few) just plain suck at their jobs. You will get no help from them and they certainly don't give a flip about your feedback.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

2) Times goes by fast, always something to do.
3) For the most part, wonderful customers who appreciate good customer service
4) Good hours if you're in college or need to work nights/weekends
cons: Where do I start?  The management needs some training on how to communicate with one another.  They all had different techniques and styles of managing which is fine, but they were hardly ever on the same page.  I actually really liked the work I did at Banana, and probably would have stayed if the managers would have encouraged me to stay and help inform me of how to advance in the company.  Our DM was completely out of the loop-NO comunnication whatsoever with our store manager even though she tried reaching out to him.  They really stress making credit card goals and sales goals but there is absolutely no incentive to do make the goals.  A year ago, if you made the ""platinum circle"" you would get commission  (.5%) but at least it was something.  Well, you have to basically requalify for the platinum circle or you loose your commission and they make it almost impossible to reach the goals as they are too high especially for a low volume store like mine.  Banana Republic's biggest mistake is not paying their outstanding employees good enough.  I guess they don't understand that the quality employees are going to leave if they don't feel like they are making what they deserve.] =",terrible,bad,bad

[pros: The pay, if you can get them to pay you what they claim they will. Bonuses are nice, at least when oil is not plummeting. There is coffee and water in the break room. You may get to work with people you find somewhat enjoyable. Vendors will attempt to bribe your business with food and other goodies.
cons: The position is impossible because there is no leverage against vendors to abide by their stated lead times. This makes the expediter role asinine, and you wind up being a glorified material tracker. They will verbally agree to a salary and then let you know after you start that they ""had to reduce it"". They will offer you positions to stay that never arise. Office politics are crucial for job security. Zero loyalty reciprocated and very few avenues to advance your career among complacent check-cashers.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

I’ve never seen such extreme favoritism in my life, they refuse to update their systems yet if there’s any discrepancy they will 100% blame it on you. Their work-life balance is a joke, even after putting your heart and soul into your work they’ll turn around one day and decide to fire you for any excuse they can come up with. No formal training, they run on a sink or swim mentality. Only way to succeed is to throw coworkers under the bus. God forbid that you’re human and make a mistake, forget ever being able to redeem yourself they’ll start a paper trail and your days there are numbered.

[pros: My team and a handful of employees.
cons: -No pay rises, no bonuses, no staff party, no rewards whatsoever. Moral is so low, depressing going to work everyday 
- Rude, intimidating management who bully you and who don't know how to run a business, you're treated like school children, and not respected at all. Basically you have to do what management say, despite them being wrong 99% of the time.
-The staff discount is pointless because LA is always on sale, which means the brand is always cheapened. The product is also getting worse.
- Horrible head office (we're talking no windows, falling apart at the seams, mice)
- No one listens or respects anyones opinion despite being an expert in your field
- All work is done poorly because no one is rewarded for anything so basically nobody cares about anything.
- Half an hour lunch is not long enough to get away from the office considering there is absolutely nothing around. 
- Staff turnover is HUGE; if you are there for more than 6 months you are considered an old-timer.

Often, conflicting objectives between opertating units combined with impossible performance goals for individuals can make for an almost psychotic environment, with no hope of a satisfying day at the office.

[pros: Great Vacation PTO. Competitive Salary
cons: Poor structure on the global side. You might want to ask if you are part of the global team or US team. The US team is very organized with career paths, responsibilities and assistance. I joined the Global Finance team. I walked in to nobody. I had no assistance, an incorrect budget and it was planning season. I had to basically do what I thought was right and recreate the current budget and create the one for the next year in my first month. Again this was with no assistance. I would go through about 20 different financial plans for each group because right when all of your numbers were together leadership would implement a new change that basically required running everything all over again. At the same time leadership puts projects on you while you are in busy season to be finished in busy season. Ultimately Deloitte is a great company depending on whether or not your group is important or not. Performance means nothing in the Global groups.

[pros: You get to spend a time discussing your favorite games, and interacting with customers who share similar (at times) passions.
cons: Forced to sell subscriptions, but are not rewarded with bonuses or commission. In fact, your only reward for meeting your goal is to not get fired...but that will come as quickly as a dry spell. 

There is absolutely no job security. If you don't meet standards, irrespective of your position, you will be canned. For instance, if you work in a low-sales area which has seen high turnover due to past poor performance of management (which wasn't their fault, but rather the local economy, or customer base),  you will be treated as though the low sales are indicative of your efforts.

If not for the dedication of the real, caring ""average"" employee, patient care would be in the toilet.  The  most difficult mine field to traverse is the political one.

[pros: In terms of positives, there are potentially a few if you work for Encore. If you're seeking to learn, there's allot of opportunities, whether that be through more experienced techs, or the Encore university training (which is honestly a pretty thorough and helpful video course). The other positive for me was getting to work at a very beautiful location.
cons: Don't take this job. It goes without saying that jumping into live events during a pandemic isn't the greatest career choice, but Encore is deceptive. For example, I was guaranteed full time hours only to find out later that if we didn't have enough events going on, they refused to give me my minimum, even when there was plenty of administrative work to do (cleaning, organizing, prepping for future events). 

I think it's fairly scummy to guarantee full time when you can't actually provide it. Over the many months I tried to make it work at Encore, I RARELY received a 40 hour week. Also, there were multiple two week gaps of ZERO hours throughout the year, such as Thanksgiving and Christmas. Which might sound nice initially, but they don't even come close to giving you enough sick time or PTO to cover these gaps. So regardless, you're going to have periods where you're unofficially laid off until someone decides to host a conference. Also, if a Covid variant spikes and you have a month where half of your events cancel, you're screwed. For me, this meant only one day of work a week, with strange, short hours that barely made the commute worth it. 

What really makes this company a bad place to work is the lack of transparency. If a location cannot guarantee full time work, stop hiring full time hourly employees then cutting their hours. If you promise an employee full time work, honor that regardless of the season. In my experience, when my hours were brutally cut, there was PLENTY of work to do at the location, but when I complained that I needed at least 30 hours, (as opposed to like 12) I was told it ""wasn't in the budget"".

The management at my location was pleasant, but the problems start at the top. The way the company is structured, there is little support for the actual non-salaried employees.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: Work life balance
Sunnyvale location
competitive pay
a *handful* of smart people
cons: Horrible management - absolutely amateurs when it comes to ""leading"" the company. There is so much of politics and promotions are decided on the basis of who can indulge in more bootlicking of the management. It gets frustrating when you realize that you could have just slacked off instead of working hard with so much passion to be where you are. Some people who got promoted don't even know what they were doing! What was the basis of promotions? And then these layoffs - some of them were very talented, hardworking people who sucked at politics. So there you go - talent does not matter in this company.
The good talent leaves, the rest just make things worse for the ones who stay. Don't even think this place comes close to the top companies in terms of benefits, work culture or organization.
The Cat Dev team is a joke that keeps doing reorgs thinking new management can solve their problems when in reality they are unable to find respectable, experienced people to lead.

[pros: 1. Great work/life balance. There's not many companies I know that have a consistent a 40hr work week, and pay top salary.
2. Cool projects to work on. Good balance between research & development. (See caveats below though.)
3. Supportive, healthy, psychologically safe work environment. Google cares a ton about how we work, and how we work together. The bottom-up culture also means that we have a lot of self-determination and don't feel like we're at the mercy of our management.
4. Super easy internal mobility. Lots of us change teams every couple of years. Google has so many different types of work that you won't feel you're ""stuck"" -- as long as you like working at Google overall, then you'll be able to find something interesting.
5. It's Google! Having Google on your resume opens doors to other opportunities, and it's great for networking too since generally your colleagues will be top of their field.
cons: 1. Entitlement. I make literally 5x as much as I ever dreamt. The comp is insane at FAANG companies like Google. But people here constantly complain about salary, the quality of the free food, why they have to work 5 days a week.... these are sometimes the same people who work 20 hrs a week. The amount of entitlement is insane here -- yes, we're the best of the best and we deserve a lot. But the culture and perks tend to pamper us.

2. Not all teams and projects have fulfilling work. There's lots of options, but choose carefully. Maybe you're happy getting paid to do nothing, on a team that has no visibility, so that you can ""rest and vest"" and coast. But, this will leave you woefully unprepared for your next job.... any company will hire you after Google, but that doesn't mean you'll do well at any company, particularly if you go to a more fast paced environment.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

cons: I recently was hired and ever since I've been a constant target for harassment by management, I constantly feel like I'm being watched and I've seen this happen with other new employees as well.The work load they assign you during a shift is outrageous and if you don't get it done within an insane amount of time you hear about it. Your breaks will often get cut short, if you get one at all. Not to mention, they treat customers like absolute royalty while constantly reprimanding employees for not saying hi to every single one that walks past you. And as a side note, I witnessed a customer yelling and cursing at a young girl at front end and the store director apologizes to the abusive customer while sending this poor cashier home early in tears. Also, we were told to park in an adjacent lot so customers can have more spots. I was told by 1 manager to move my car from the side of the building where we normally park, later to find out at a later work date she never parked differently.
In short, management is a bunch of power hungry control freaks.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

cons: Provides the proper place: Under modern store keeping, each item of the material is kept at proper place so that at the time of need it may be obtained easily. If any material is not kept at proper place and is not available when required then the advantages of store keeping are not fully derived.
Leads to minimum inventory investment: It avoids the material in stores and thus enables the company to have more profitable use of working capital by way of minimum inventory of investment.
Leads to easy identification and specification of materials: Store keeping will make easy identification and specifications of materials in store. It will also help in using the oldest materials first on the basis of first in first out. It provides for proper storage space, equipment and scientific location of the store rooms.
Materials estimation in anticipation: Store keeping is a link between purchasing and production. The efficient and economical receiving’s, handling, and issuing of store items, will save the investment in inventory and further it will facilitate ordering of needed materials. So, the choice of right and at right place and at right time can be made for future needs of an organization.
Protection of material: By effective store keeping process, materials stored are protected against damages, deterioration, theft, pilferage, unauthorized removal etc.
Helps to minimize accident: The proper system of store keeping the materials when place in different racks, bins and shelves properly (and not in a haphazard manner) will help in minimizing the cases of accidents.
Quality & Cost: Modern age is the age of specialization. Qualitative goods are to be produced at lesser and lesser cost. Poor control and bad store keeping may result in the issuance of old, Semi-obsolescent materials to the factory which would create the problem of product quality. This will also create marketing problems for the company and in extreme case, may affect its reputation.
Enables the continuous production: Stoppage in manufacturing operations is minimized by ensuring continuous flow of materials needed for the different jobs. Thus, production schedules are not dislocated and therefore promised delivery dates are maintained. Stock position is easily known which enables timely replenishment of stock of the needed items once the stock reaches the minimum level.
Reduces mismanagement: A regular analysis will be possible in order to control losses, wastages, obsolescence and pilferage and have updated information on material requirements. The good system of store keeping will be helpful in measuring, counting and weighing the store items.
Other benefits: Store keeping also make easy identification of materials in a store due to application of classification and codification system with the result there is no problem in the process of issuing the material to the concerned department.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

[pros: Only good thing was that it was close to where I live.
cons: So many but mostly it was a toxic work environment. Terrible schedule no flexibility whatsoever. Horrible work/life balance due to terrible schedule. This place was upside down cause usually at a normal job you'll get in trouble for being late. This one was the complete opposite. You'd get in trouble if you came in early. I don't if its a Chinese cultural thing but it certainly isn't compatible with American culture.

The manager was the worst I've had. Guy was running the department like a sweat shop. Called him Rocket Man cause he looked and acted like the North Korean dictator and even looked so much like him! He has no people skills and doesn't know how to treat people. Maybe being rude to people was acceptable to wherever he came from but not here. That doesn't fly here. My only regret is not reporting him to HR because of the way he is.

The training was horrible as well. It was mostly compromised of asking questions while they barely taught you how to do anything. Like there was stuff that came up that you didn't know so you couldn't ask a question about it cause you had no idea what it was. No one there wanted to take responsibility so they would always pin it on you even though they trained you to do it that way even though it was incorrect. 

This was one of the departments that has a high turnover rate and for good reasons.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

[pros: ORM is the foremost publisher of technical errata for OSS technologies.  Being an employee gives you unfettered access to their library.

Conferences are pretty awesome and well executed.  

The working staff are smart.
cons: ORM has a dishonest and functionally self absorbed executive culture that values the status quo above all else.  The CEO and CTO are functionally bullies and actively create a culture of fear.  In order to succeed at the executive layer in this company, you must be ready to do what you are told and keep you mouth shut.

ORM routinely engages in political stacking and has regular purges.  These usually occur in the spring time and they tend to fire people who are not in complete alignment with senior exec staff, or who do not conform to the corporate normative mean.

They also routinely landfill valuable technical manuals that they publish rather than provide them to nonprofits or schools, an industry-typical practice that illuminates the real values operating the company. 

This company is doomed to a long slow death as its brightest and best are continuously ejected from the company, leaving unimaginative and self-involved leadership managing a workforce that is constantly in fear of losing their jobs.

[pros: You get a free platinum membership if you are at a platinum gym or lower, if you are at a higher one you get the membership to the level gym you work at. You're  allowed 12 guest in a 12 month span but each person can only come once every 60 days. You get discounts to things in the cafe (but only on things that the staff can make and on supplements) and in in spa (but only on things done to you and on products). You will meet a ton of people, make friends, and a lot of networking.
cons: Way under paid 
Demands too much 
Big brother is always watching
No room for growth (unless you're incredibly lucky)
No work/life balance 
This company pushes the heck out of everything.  They want you to know everything about everything, regardless if you work in that department or not. The members think they are entitled to everything. They have random audits and have unrealistic goals. They demand so much from each individual but the pay doesn't compensate whatsoever. The Manager on duty tops out at $15/hr but only on the days they are MOD, otherwise it drops down to their normal pay grade. They try to attempt to push the ""culture"" but usually only in times when they know corperate is coming and if we get a really bad aduit.

cons: While the store manager who hired me was very competent and kind, she was only there a few times a week and the other store manager was quite the opposite. Available shifts were not very plentiful and I found myself having to call the managers several times each week in order to get scheduled, often times only for very short shifts which were barely enough to justify part-time employment there. I was trained on a Sunday to fulfill my duties as a Stylist, yet I was expected to pick up slack for the grossly understaffed store. I was expected to be in 3 places at one time, including front room greeting customers and in the back managing fitting rooms and go-backs. I was put on register duty one day despite not yet having been trained with the store's OS, leading to a clearly unproductive experience for the customer and embarrassment for me.] =",bad,neutral,bad

[pros: If you have a good team and good work (which there is/are plenty of) then you'll love your time at Bloomberg.

Contributions to open source are allowed and there are a number of contributions of internally developed technologies that have been open sourced as well.

The company has a very social and open culture where talking with people is encouraged and people are approachable at all levels and in all roles.

Bloomberg's size and problem space means that sometimes there are no open source alternatives or that it is necessary to drill down and improve an existing open source solution. Smaller companies I worked for had to compromise but Bloomberg is able to invest the time into creating great technologies if you can justify its need.
cons: It's luck of the draw as to which team you will land in.

As a senior you will directly be applying to a team while as a junior developer you will first be trained and then have a chance to apply to teams that are hiring.

Dealing with work that requires help from other teams runs into issues if that team does not have your work as a high priority on their side and leads to frustrating workarounds or just project stalls alltogether.

The social company culture can at times mean you get interrupted a lot by people asking for help with things you own so be careful what you take ownership of.] =",excellent,good,excellent
