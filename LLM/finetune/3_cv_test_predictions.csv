cons: Management can never seem to be on the same page.

On the payments processing front the focus has shifted from putting the customer first to how fast can we move this problem out of the way, even if it is not fully resolved.

[pros: Generally good people to work with, fairly competitive pay from what I understand. Not a bad place to get your start.
cons: The Hartford has been hemorrhaging underwriters (for good reason) without replacing them. It seems to be an industry trend to get your start here and then get out. Workloads and expectations have been unreasonable, which is probably the reason for so much turnover, but it has only gotten worse given the understaffing. If you join underwriting , expect to work 10-12 hour days consistently. 

Underwriters are expected to navigate a labyrinth of poorly organized, often out-of-date, best practices before making even the most minor of decisions while juggling very high caseloads. If a mistake is made, or often even if a mistake is thought to have been maybe potentially made, you will brought into a condescending meeting with someone from quality management who hasn't been on the floor in 15 years and your manager. It's a stressful, overbearing environment where overtime and perfect work are effectively the expectation. Often you're basically put into the position of project manager, herding other departments on both inforce and presale cases and if anything goes wrong on a case, regardless of whether or not it was your call, it somehow falls back on you. Some managers are better than others in recognizing this in practical terms, but ultimately all underwriters (and their bonuses) are graded under this standard. 

By and large, the managers and leadership are good people and good underwriters, but poor at management. Leaderships tends to be overly hesitant of offending sales reps or sales management, so approaches to appeals are typically soft, which often creates more work for the understaffed underwriting team. It's hard to be too harsh on the directors though, as they seem to consistently be working 12 hour days given the number of everyday underwriting decisions that need to go to them for approval. 

The best practice team is purportedly meant to be a help/ guide for underwriters, but the reality is that the company's best practices are a mountain of 30 years of updates that are not easily presented or navigable. The standards set on underwriting are impossible to meet with current workloads. You'd be working 80 hour weeks if you followed every guideline to the T and fully researched everything like you are expected to.] =",bad,bad,none

[pros: Nice offices, nice trainings (though you would have to “pay” for that training by working overtime to catch up with your work so that training has no effect on achieved business result), many nice and professional people.
Sometimes we get some nice extras, like gifts or parties.
cons: A lot of politics and “behind the scenes”. Top management talks a lot about policy of openness and need to speak up. But in reality there is local management, and when you speak up, that can be used to evaluate your performance and career progression. Even personal things. Directors should understand that what they discuss about employees in management meetings slips through.

Very high expectations, but salary doesn’t match. To be promoted (and this is how you told, not just assumption), you need to work in current role with current salary, but do amount of work of a senior role. For about a year. Then maybe will get promotion or a few percent of increase.

[pros: The amazing sales assistants you get to work with
cons: Store managers and assistant store manager jobs advertised as 39hrs a week. Total rubbish!!  You are allocated a total number of working hours a week to your store that has to be divided up between your sales assistants, but that number is usually so low that the only way to run your store is do 60+ yourself, on a permanent basis. If your lucky you might get enough time to eat lunch, but in over 3 years working for the company I never once had  anywhere near a full lunch break. If you complain you are spoken down to and  told you are not managing your time effectively, yet they cannot come up with a solution when you present them with evidence of rota's etc.  You are encouraged to join the Job Center trainee scheme to get 'extra staff for free' which is NOT what the scheme was set up for. Daily bullying over the SAS (upselling at the till). Never any positive recognition.  They mislead employees into leaving positive reviews on various websites to counteract all the bad reviews. Favouritsm and bullying is rife with many of the area managers, but I must point out that if you are lucky you will come across the exception to the rule, but as the area mangers change the areas they oversee every 6 months or so it never lasts long.    This company have some amazing people working for them, but they are under-appreciated, demoralised, and generally treated pretty badly.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: There are lots of lovely people to work with and you may make some great friends there. 

Can get massive bonus depending on campaign and skill. 

Some managers work very hard for both their staff and the client.
cons: Never worked in an environment so negative and toxic before. Sexual harassment and sexual assault are prevalent and the perpetrators do not get punished in anyway for it. It may depend on the campaign and the site etc what your experience would be like at webhelp. 

I am a relatively new employee but in my short time here I have witnessed sexual harassment, gross misconduct and I have personally been threatened by another employee. 

Although there is room for bonus it does depend on the campaign and some have very tough targets to meet to get that bonus. Also any conduct issues will result in you not being paid your bonus, such as absence or lateness etc, which is reasonable. But point is they will do what they can not to pay your bonus if you are earning a lot of it. 

Very clear favouritism from management meaning that some can do whatever they like and not get in any trouble. Definitely one rule for one and another for the other. 

Absence policy means that people force themselves into work when sick because there isnt paid sickness etc. In an office environment and especially this time of year that means a massive number of people off sick for the same illness, sometimes more than once, which could have been avoided by one person staying home to recover. 

Client comes first, which is not necessarily unreasonable. However this results is a massively high turnover as little focus on staff welfare or health. 

In all fairness there are many of the same issues in any outsourced sales environment, where there is high turnover and increasingly intense demands to meet from the client. However, my experience at WebHelp has been the worst I've ever had and in such a short amount of time. 

Unfortunately, I cant recommend this company from my own experience. If you are a man with high sales skills and you get on in a high pressure and social environment, then this could very well be a great job for you. Also, anyone with any ongoing health issues, physical or mental, shouldn't work in this type of company simply because the absence policies are not supportive of those with medical issues. 

I also believe that payroll and HR may be outsourced (though not entirely sure) and this may be why they can be incredibly difficult to contact in regards to any payment issues or concerns that would be taken up with HR.] =",terrible,terrible,none

cons: Was expected to do more than what my position specified. Managers were lazy, and avoided angry guest. Kitchen staff was unsanitary and overly aggressive. Servers were lazy and didn't do their job in a timely manner. Unsatisfactory working environment.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Easy work
They pay the salary
cons: School kids could run better this place than the disorganised chaos that it is right now.

-They don't know how many people they have in their headcount
-Many people are confused about their roles, especially after the Sainsbury's Tech restructure
-Management is even more confused and they admit it openly!
-Incompetent leadership only cares about superficial messages but no substance, no direction, no vision, no goals, no answers...
-People are treated like minions, who are expected to just show up without knowing if they will have a job tomorrow, leadership doesn't care about our wellbeing and many people are gradually suffering from mental health issues
- There are no defined career paths
-TCS and other consultancies are running the show
-Politics are paralysing everything. For instance, project teams sitting without work for months while senior managers backstab each other to see who wins.
-They say they are doing agile but they have no clue about it. Byzantine bureaucratic financial and admin processes waste people's time and prevent any idea of agility.
-There are senior managers that spend the whole working day watching youtube, browsing facebook, doing shopping. 
-No one cares and no one has the complete picture of the chaos.
-They struggle to hire people and tend to promise everything in the interviews just to get people through the door
-Dishonest organisation promising the world to candidates but when they join the reality is totally different.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: The only pro is I have met and become friends with some great people.
cons: Management sucks to say the least. If you want to go far in this company then you better become apart of the smoking crew, drinking after work crew, and willing to sleep with someone crew. I have NEVER in life worked for a company as unethical and sneaky as National General. No matter how much experience you have you will not move up unless you are friends or family of managements. They are only worried about service levels and not the quality of service being provided.The moral in this place is non existent. The management will try to justify every wrong doing and they are the biggest liars. Also they are all incompetent and pure idiots. I believe management is suppose to lead by example but that is not the case with NGIC. You have managers playing loud disruptive music at their desk, walking around on their cell phone all day, going on smoke breaks every 30 mins, and worrying about what bar to visit after work. If you can answer a phone and some what read then they will hire you.  If you looking for a company to advance in and stay long term NGIC is not it matter of fact if you see them hiring run the other way fast.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: - The benefits are some of if not the best in the area. 
- The Drake facility is a beautiful piece of property.
cons: - Supervisors are weak and will not fight for a higher raise for employees 
- Technicians from California and techs hired in Colorado may have the same job title but the pay is completely different. You will never make as much as the California techs are no matter how skilled. 
- If you are production or R&O, you annual and level up raises are significantly smaller than the engineers. Yours will normally top out at 4% if you are lucky, engineers can easily get 8-13%. 
- The Drake facility is losing its talent FAST. This was making for long hours and 6 day work weeks. 
- Drake facility had multiple layoffs in the beginning days of the pandemic. Not just contractors, but employees they had moved across the country, and managers who had been with the company for decades.

[pros: Most colleagues were friendly, and the work was fairly simple. The colleague responsible for the shift rota was great, which meant flexible hours around other commitments. Mostly good music would play, and it felt good to help customers.

There is no job security, COVID-19 awareness, or any true professionalism from upper management -- as to be expected from menial low payed work in the retail sector.

At times the work felt lonely, which can leave one feeling insular and self-conscious. This wasn't aided by the extroverted nature of the brand and colleagues, and perhaps should be avoided by more reserved individuals.

[pros: The starting salary is good for the little experience required. The coworkers are typically very interesting people from various back grounds. The office building is great.
cons: If you are reading this you are either a director responding to reviews or a candidate deciding on working for CoStar. Here is a little bit to help you guide your decision. You will get a job that requires you to do the same thing day in and day out. The metrics are based on a monthly cycle but evaluated daily. This means one off day, one rare hangover, one night tossing and turning with no sleep and you will be reprimanded for your performance. Be ready to be under a microscope. The manager will push for performance because it directly impacts their yearly bonus. Since I started working here the job title has change 2 times. Each change has greatly increased the work load and not eased any of the original metrics. You will spend most of your day talking to brokers over the phone to get them to disclose privileged information about their deals. You will be required to call those broker at a minimum of once a month. I have worked in several different markets and I would say about 20% of an given portfolio consists of brokers who value your conversations. So yes, you will be required to speak to clients that do not want to talk to you. As a candidate make sure you are prepared to overcome objections and have mental strength to do that on a daily basis. As for promotions, this is your basic plan. You will start as a researcher I after a year your are eligible for researcher II. After 3 years you are eligible for senior researcher but be cautions very very few employees qualify and make it through the process. The company used to promote employees on a quarterly cycle. This past year they changed it to semi annually and recently to annually. This means that if you miss a promotion opportunity you are stuck for at a minimum 1 year. Be ready for constant change and a stressful environment. I am not saying it is a terrible place to work, but be aware of what you are signing up for.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

A number of opportunities are limited to the HQ employees and it is difficult for field/branch agents to promote into desirable positions outside of sales/sales mgmt.  Company is in aggressive growth mode that is alienating tenured agents by bringing numerous new employees with low knowledge of the industry.

[pros: Many of the direct service staff and some upper management are great people who care immensely for the work they do and the people they serve. They are the heart behind this agency.
cons: Opportunity for advancement is low. Promotions and lateral job openings are often given based on politics rather than qualifications. The CEO would rather lay off key upper management and staff than refuse the annual raise on her 300k salary though many program staff have gone years with no increase.  Agency decisions are often made based on whims and wants rather than based on what is best for the agency. The agency is so focused on collecting grant money that they ignore the feasibility of their staff to preform the tasks that come along with it and consequently set them up for failure. Staff retention and turnover is some of the worst I have ever seen. Staff moral is extremely low and the CEO is in complete denial.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: Good people to work with while on the SPOC, mostly
Can have fun at work, sometimes
Know where you stand, rarely
Reasonable and attainable goals, seldom
cons: The Phoenix SPOC has unfair hiring practices and is very unprofessional. They say they prefer to higher from within but in reality, they hire from outside and expect the existing employees to train the new person.

I interviewed for several jobs and was not told I did not get the jobs, nor was I told what I could to better on future interviews.

My review for my last year was not even for the job I was doing. My review was negative as a result.

The seem to expect champagne support on a beer budget.

If you are not on the ""popular"" list you will not get far. If you have ideas or ask questions you will be taken off the ""popular"" list.

You are told it is not a call center but all the metrics and stats are for calls.
Calls calls calls

If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is not a dog.

If you're not on the ""popular"" list you dont exist and don't matter. You're phone fodder.

Things went down hill when the SPOC Mom died over a year ago :(

I interviewed for a field engineer position and did not get the job.\
I found out when I heard the hiring manager talking to another enigneer, in front of me, that they were waiting for the candidate to accept the offer and start.
When the new engineer, hired from outside (not promoted from the SPOC), I had to train him on CITRIX because he had ZERO citrix experience.
Please explain how a new hire from outside is the best candidate over someone with almost 5 years experience with the company and already has a professional relationship with the customers I would be supporting in the new role,

I was the engineer for my team, but spent half my day answering calls because of various staffing issues, usually not enough people on the SPOC to handle the call volumes.

It got so bad that other teams were taking calls from outher team's customers. Meanwhile that team had no way to support that customer on the phone because they did not have credentials in the customer environment. See the logic in that? None of us did either.
Team A grabs a call for Team B which means that Team B cannot grab their calls because they are taking calls for Team A, and Team will take calls for Team B because Team B is busy taking Team A calls. ILLOGICAL...

Just supports the fact is it all about the calls and not the customer experience or support. CALLS CALLS CALLS.
90 seconds to answer and 15 minutes to fix the problem for a customer you do not have credentials for or support.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: If you want to work for a government entity, the County is a good starting point. Depending on the department, you will learn various clerical and accounting skills. They offer a benefits package, vacation and sick accruals, and the salary is decent. There is room for growth for many entry level positions.
cons: Management and supervision is poor in many departments. I worked for three different departments over the eight years I worked there and leadership is extremely poor. Thorough job training is not always provided so you end up self-training. Many departments suffer from lack of morale due to poor management. Promotional opportunities are not merit based, and supervisors can hinder you from being promoted within a department. Health insurance premiums are high and increase every year. Retirement package for non-management employees is a mandatory 8% with no match from the county. County funds are mismanaged and not well spent, resulting in many cutbacks in other areas which always affect the employees (layoffs, no pay increases, increased employee paid premiums.] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: Decent benefits, and plenty of FTO if you can pull enough teeth to get it scheduled.
cons: Agents are under constant stress by sociopathic management that knows little to nothing about the work their agents are responsible for, and the efforts of said agents who do care about their work. Prejudice and favoritism runs alarmingly wild in this dept. management backs up management whether right or wrong, and the HR generalist who resides over the dept. follows the same archaic methodology. Several management figures in this dept. have HR backgrounds and are therefore skilled in knowing exactly how far they can go without actually breaking any labor laws, but ethics are out the window. If management trains their cross-hairs on an agent, they will micromanage and frustrate said agent to the point that his/her work will suffer, which in turn gives them additional leverage to push their agenda. Every breath an agent takes is is monitored, micromanaged and psychoanalyzed. Agents are routinely followed to the restroom if nature calls in between scheduled break times, and if one is unable to hold their business to coincide with scheduled breaks with any amount of regularity, management will pressure you beginning with verbal reprimands. Agents are given exactly 2 minutes to boot their computers, and launch/setup 8-10 apps and systems before they are reprimanded for being tardy, despite being there on time, so agents end up having to begin work without being paid, so their systems are ready when their shift begins. The dept is managed via a system of metrics and said metrics would constantly overshadow good work, and proper IT practices. As such, agents would routinely resort to a ""spit and duck tape"" approach, up to and including informing end-users to ""reboot and call back"" simply to keep their metrics, and the ire of management in check. This is'nt IT work, and it actually costs the company more money in the long run, as problems are'nt being fixed properly the first time. This results in an inability for the end-user to maintain productivity, and having to call back multiple times until someone takes ownership of the problem and fixes it properly, but this normally results in an agents efforts and abilities being called into question because they ""took too long"". If one is able to manage their way through this toxic, oppressive and constrained environment, you now have the privilege of having a manager with little to no IT background downplay the last year of blood, sweat, tears, never-ending call cues, and consistently high quality work, on their way to justifying little to no annual raise. Turnover was relatively high during my 3.5 years, once people got a taste of this dept, and more often than not, management would poke fun at the aforementioned people, often saying, ""They couldn't hack it"".

[pros: Fun, interesting work. Great culture, opportunity to learn on the job.
cons: My first year as an instructor I was given the youngest cohort to work with. Several of the children in my class had learning disabilities and required special attention.  I had experience prior to that  as a tutor and babysitter for a few kids at a time, and working large parties for children as part of a group, but had never had to handle a class that large before on my own. 

We were not allowed to use any system for behavior management other than positive reinforcement. 

Every week I would ask for help with this. Saying it wasn't working and my class was out of control. Was there a process by which I could escalate and receive additional support?

Every week I was told to just try harder before being let go the second to last week of the summer for ""child endangerment"" because some of my kids were seen in the food line by themselves, on a day when there were almost no open tables, only one entrance in and out to the cafe, and countless other instructors in line, and I had went to go hold us a table with some of the other kids.

Honestly, at 19, I can't say I wasn't totally underqualified for this role and that this wasn't the right decision. Though that they waited until the last week before summer ended I thought was bad form in all respects. If I was really a danger to those kids, how unacceptable for me to have lasted that whole summer? If I wasn't, and it was the support systems that were inadequate, how disrespectful to force me to bear the brunt of that alone and then keep me on just long enough to not have to look for a replacement mid-season? 

On the day  I was let go, I was offered a $100 tip by one of the parents, who admitted after, ""People don't know how to manage my son. He can be really challenging. He loves your class, though, learned a lot, and felt really supported by you. Thank you so much for your work.""

I haven't tried to work with children since leaving this job. I have a newfound respect for amount of training that should actually require. I am sad for how this played out for me and I hope other people have a better experience. I hope the kids in my classes felt safe and supported and I hope they weren't negatively impacted by my inability to give them all the attention they deserved. No parent complained about me the entire time I worked there. I never got a bad review and wish I had gotten more insight into how to improve earlier in the season.] =",good,bad,bad

The managers also are constantly looking and reminding you of your rates which is stressful even if you’re above the quota. You are allowed to make few mistakes 1 per every thousand units you stow ( which I find ridiculous) I also take public transportation and at the moment I work from 6pm to 4:30am.

[pros: Sodexo has many properties, and always has opportunities for employment. They are the leader in the leisure/service industry and are progressive in their approach to enhancing customers' dining experiences whether it be in a dining hall, staff cafeteria or public park. Their approach to innovation has given them some great successes and made their business model very profitable in certain areas.
cons: Sodexo's model is all about profitability above everything else. Many times, key elements such as quality, logic and safety are outweighed by the need to exceed profit margins. If you work for Sodexo, don't expect to be smiling and happy like the folks on the HR brochures. Expect to work 7 day weeks, 12-14 hours a day. Expect to be denied time off for doctor's appointments, home emergencies and more important things like family events like birthdays and weddings. Expect to live at Sodexo and hotel at home. I barely see my family anymore. I haven't taken a vacation in two years. I'm lucky if I get a day off in the middle of the week. Management says things are critical and they can't give us any time off right now. We are woefully understaffed. The work is never done. 

Also, while Sodexo is an innovative company, they apply a cookie-cutter approach to most of their properties. They are unyielding in the need to acknowledge that no two properties are built alike. Customer bases are different, customer needs are different and thus how you organize your operations is going to differ from place to place. Sodexo has a model they try to force down every organization's pipeline. If they think it takes 12 widgets to run the operation when you know it needs 20, they expect you to make it work with the 12. No exceptions.

And don't expect to be given the tools to do your job. I was expected to use my personal cell phone and laptop to do my job. I use my personal vehicle to make inventory pick-ups. I pay out of pocket for inventory and have to wait to be reimbursed. Sodexo is all about keeping those profit margins clean, and the less money, the less resources they have to cough up, the better it is for them.

If I had it to do all over again, I would have said no to Sodexo.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

[pros: Great training, always available to learn more; co-workers are great- wonderful work environment; can work from home in many positions. Company is respected worldwide- easy to find a job somewhere else (for more money) after doing ""time"" at ADP.
cons: Pay remains at 75% of other companies; ADP relies on its reputation to get quality employees, then tricks you into doing two or three jobs. Upper mobility is difficult for minorities- only a couple of token minorities allowed in upper management. Racism and tone policing are part of the performance strategy, since the mono-culture doesn't understand (or care to understand) cultural differences. Raises are also almost non-existent- expect to make near the same money 5 years into your tenure. Crony-ism, nepotism, sexism, and favoritism are the words of the day- ADP depends on its lawyers to keep things quiet, but I've heard of some really messed up stuff happening over the years.] =",terrible,bad,bad

[pros: Concentrix takes good care of their employees. I had to take time off right after my training ended. I was half-expecting that I was going to be fired but given that I had a valid reason, they let me join the next training they had.

Then during my second go at training and transition, my class had to be halted due to CoVID 19. One thing that Concentrix did, unlike (virtually) all of the other companies out there is to provide a portion of salary every pay even without working. Those who went to work had bonuses through the roof. We have shuttles, dedicated Grab, and a very understanding management. Recently they gave out CoVID kits to those working on site.
I've only been here for under a year but I'm happy I applied here.

Facilities wise the bathroom is spotless. We have sleeping quarters, you just have to bring a blanket and maybe a bedsheet and a pillow. We can also request to use the shower room however I haven't had the chance nor the need to yet.
cons: Their hiring process took me 13 hours, start to finish. They practice one day hiring and taken that I was there from their opening at 11 am until 1am I'd say it's inefficient.

[pros: Decent salary, employee sample sale, store discount, and if you work in PR or Events, travel to really cool events (I was not part of these departments, however)
cons: Ridiculous expectations for team members who are not management level, management attends meetings all day, no work, upper management attends meetings all day but do not share feedback with workers, C-level management and executives do not  know how to make decisions, are afraid to make decisions, and do not consider the production schedules in place for a reason - which creates turmoil for working team members along with long and stressful hours of unnecessary work.

I had high hopes for a career...a lasting career at a place I believed was perfect to flourish in an environment of something I truly believe in, crafting and inspiration. Inside the corporate office, the environment is something completely different. Nearly every day, I was afraid of saying the wrong thing to the wrong person, wearing the wrong clothing, and coming to the table with new ideas for fear that this would intimidate anyone at a higher level than me that I was going to ""steal"" their job. It had nothing to do with the excellent work I performed, the processes I put into place, the position I created and the order I restored to a department that hardly existed when I got there.

That was another thing....I was hired in for a particular position, but my first day, even my manager said, ""we're not entirely sure what you'll be doing, but don't worry, you will be doing something!""

This leads to shoddy work and unhappy customers.... all to ""deliver and delight'! Sandbagged processing of orders before I left so as to not pay me commission. There's no actually using your vacation time. Unless you're management you're rarely going to have more than the afternoon off. Even if you do have time off approved everyone is so overloaded you'll have a mountain of work waiting for you when you get back. They claim to care about their customers. This is a farce.

Managers refused to take any calls and would always send to voicemail, and then you have to deal with the customer when they call back.

Having different versions to different people why no salary increase so, in other words just lies as to why.

[pros: I haven't seen any yet. The package is not a big one. In theory I've private insurance, but nobody has contacted me about that. It is also supposed that there's a workplace pension, but I haven't heard anything about it either. 25 days of holiday leave, which is quite normal in the business. Commuting allowance. No other extras like gym, bike/car scheme, nursery or anything like that.
cons: Cons? All, as they gave me a computer, a phone, and they boot me off the main offices to site. I don't have means to contact IT, because everything is in German and the only option for English is Google translate, which doesn't always work.
Their extremely restrictive IT policy means that I can't install for example, Google Earth, which simplifies my job, and there's no option to ask for it, or maybe I haven't seen it because EVERYTHING is in German. I'm not even allowed to install extensions in Chrome or Edge. I can't install the drivers for the docking station either, so I'm stuck with a 13.3 inch screen. They gave me the option of having an iPhone or a Samsung. I asked for the iPhone, I received a Samsung. They monitor the internet traffic in the computer and in the phone, which I understand, but their terms are quite restrictive.

[pros: MathWorks is a great company. I started my current role mid-pandemic, and have been very impressed by how efficient and smooth both the interview and onboarding process have been. Management is very supportive and understanding, and people seem to maintain a good work-life balance. Salaries are generally pretty middle of the road relative to other tech firms in the area, but for me this is balanced out by good benefits and reasonable expectations from management. I'm hopeful that they will relax their previously strict work-from-home policy after the pandemic is over.

[pros: healthcare, 401k, stocks, friendly coworkers,
cons: Oh, you're an artist you say? An actor? A musician? Well, come on down to work at your local Apple Store! The folks at Apple love that you're creative and would like to use your innate, irreplaceable gift to sling iPhones and peddle expensive services no one asked for. They'll rope you in with the amazing healthcare, the 401k, the stock plan, and they'll even sweeten the deal by telling you that you can use your creative talents at work and get paid for it. If you'd like to direct movies then you'll perfect for selling MacBooks because you can talk to people about FinalCut Pro. If you're a musician then surely you know all kinds of stuff about Logic, so go sell more computers, you spineless selling machine! (By the way, did I mention that you will get zero commission for the thousands upon thousands of dollars you bring into this multi-trillion dollar company? That's right, no yucky competition with your fellow plebs, you'll be one big, happy family all working for the common goal of making Tim Cook dirty stinking rich while you slave away for just barely above minimum wage!) 

Then before you know it you've been working for Apple for five years, you've gotten your beloved PLAQUE and you have no idea how you'll survive in the wild because what other entry-level part-time gig will give you $19/hr? What other job can you get that will give you that sweet, sweet full coverage healthcare you've come to enjoy? Not to mention the stocks you'll lose if you quit now, so many of them have yet to vest and if you just wait one more year, two more years, threeeee moooooore yeeeears imagine the kind of money you'll have then!

Oh, and let's not forget about the Career Experiences! Apple will send a few lucky, lucky retail employees to go work up at corporate for six months curating playlists for Apple Music or fiddling alongside nerds with masters degrees on some really cool development job. And the entire time you'll be having a blast, taking pity on your coworkers still stuck at the retails store, while your new corporate managers are constantly dangling the promise of a promotion that will never come to go work permanently in Sunny Cupertino. They'll give you per diem, housing, and more money than you'll know what to do with! But then, your six month career experience will be over and you'll be shipped back to the retail store where you belong, you stinky salesperson. Turns out your theatre degree just wasn't good enough after all, so it's back to wiping boogers off of iPad screens. It's what you we're born to do. 

If you are creative in any way and would like to not be sucked into Apple's ever-churning corporate machine, then you should stay as far away from their stores as possible.

Also, have to work weekends. You won’t see your family much. Your BM can also be extremely micro-managing. Customers are mad, sending in complaints that contain lies about you just because they are mad that they can’t get their problem resolved at their definition of quickest time possible (everything takes time and the staff here are already doing their best), and the management sides with the customer, EVEN when you can prove otherwise.

[pros: Monthly gratis ( although you have to fight for it , nothing is explained on how to get it ) and discount ( when your allowed , roughly 4/5 hours a day , although managers and permanent staff can use it at their own free will , I saw this on a regular basis, unfair )
cons: Where to start ! At first i was so excited to be accepted to the onboarding for the Liverpool store but this soon wore thin once I actually started the job . The majority of permanent staff were so hostile and unfriendly , talk of us stealing their hours and not having a clue about the job were constantly mentioned , this made for a miserable existence from day 1 , some Managers were utterly unapproachable and rude , it was just shocking and often left myself and other seasonal staff on the verge of tears . Being new to the job you need to learn from others such as the permanent staff but they were not interested in the slightest and seasonal staff were often  humiliated for their mistakes over the shop radios , or on the shop floor , this is utterly degrading and embarrassing .To get by in this store you have to be a managers favourite , even if this means stealing other people's sales and talking about other staff members in a derogatory fashion just to fit in . Often , favoured temps were put in charge of other temps , this is such an unprofessional way of organising staff and getting the job done , it does nothing other than breed resentment and cause friction , it just reeks of laziness from the management and permanent staff .My time at the store left me feeling miserable and quite insecure , I work hard and was always in work and on time , but unfortunately if your face doesn't fit you might as well get your coat , as I found out . Not to be all negative , there were some lovely team members and managers , but the bad outnumber the good . All in all it wasn't the job itself , I enjoyed the work there ( even the panty bar !) and the brand is beautiful but certain staff and management at this store made the job unbearable and frankly I was relived when my contract came to an end , unless there are some major changes within the hirerachy and attitudes of the staff at this store , I couldn't and wouldn't reccomend this job to anyone .] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Post-covid the in-person meetings are pretty much non-existent which kinda changed the dynamic of the job. If you can get a spot at the WHQ or WTC in one of these roles you'll get a cushy cubicle job that's mostly done via email/conf calls if that's what you're looking for.

Good benefits - cheap-ish insurance and they are transitioning from providing a pension to an increased 401k contribution for new employees. You put in 6%, they put in 8% instead of the old 3.5% match.

If you desire it, this company is very upwardly mobile and always hiring all over the place. If not you can coast and it's damn near impossible to get fired unless you act like a complete dummy. I see both of those as pros, lol.
cons: Consistent re-orgs and old-head buyouts have shifted the employees that were experts in their area out of those roles and the problems that's caused throughout the company is immeasurable - this made a lot of jobs harder and less organized. Cubicle jobs are not for everyone, but with a good attitude you'll go far in this company.] =",neutral,good,bad

[pros: The relocation program is top notch, there is flexibility to take cash, or get the relocation company to take care of everything, or somewhere in between. I opted for the most cash. The really nice thing is that they ""Gross Up"" the relocation bonus, meaning if you qualify for $5000 in moving bonus, they pay you enough to Net $5000.  They also offer help buying and selling homes. 
I have also enjoyed working with my sub-team and shift Group leader.  The cost for medical/dental is second to none.  I understand that each facility is slightly different but They have on-site gym, massage therapists, doctors, free fruit, free fountain drinks and coffee.  I am impressed with the safety culture, especially as it relates to office ergonomics.  They will get you set up with the ergo equipment that fits you best.  Regular bonuses, a Stock purchase program, and stock award program.  Many paths for career development.  From a business standpoint, I feel that Intel is making really good strategic decisions. I am very happy to work at Intel.
cons: Changes to documentation or procedures can take a long time, Management can be a bit cryptic in ""answering"" questions or responding to feedback.

Let me begin by saying that the whole account retention fact was a hard hit due to the fact that during training we were told to just SELL. My role was a Sales consultant, not customer service and for sure not an account manager! We were reminded daily about these ridiculous “plans” we would have to get on for not meeting sales goals, poor attendance, not making call time and for account retention. I witnessed plenty of shady things that perhaps HR should be made aware of. All the better leads were given to the Reps with the highest sales and all the others were given dead or terrible leads. These poor contractors were called literally 2-3 times a week! They hate hearing from this company and most certainly the reps. After a few months and all the constant toxicity I reached a breaking point.

cons: Can be stressful if you have difficult guests, co-workers and sometimes even management.
You're really relying on good business to make a decent amount of money.

[pros: Great brand to work for and some very smart people. If you're good you can get promoted very quickly, but herein lies the problem...
cons: Workforce is probably at about 50% of what it should be in order to do a good job. Management talks about going from good to great, but that's always going to be a struggle when you just don't have time or resource. 

People get promoted quickly because there is such high staff turnover and because it's cheaper to just move someone internally. Seems like a lot of people in important roles with not a great deal of experience. A lot of knowledge and expertise has left the business with little to no plans in place to fill the gaps.

The management always tell you that feedback is really important but you can't help but think it's all lip service. They acknowledge the challenges and then don't do anything about it. They don't care about your happiness or wellbeing. All they care about is £££ for the business, hence why there is also very little focus on personal development and objectives are all based around sales and profit, even when that's not even got that much to do with your day to day role.] =",bad,terrible,bad

Another thing i didn't like about my time at greene king was that the notice periods are impractical. I had given over 2 weeks notice for a one week holiday (the first time in the 2 years of my current employment) however apparently it has to be 4 weeks which in most cases is impractical as a holiday is often booked only 3 weeks in advance these days. After giving this notice i have been threatened with a termination of my employment with the words ""You dont get to pick and choose when you work, i put your shifts on and you work them"".

POC deal with microaggressions on a daily basis -- HR either does not care or is not empowered to actually improve that
Lots of cronyism and favoritism

[pros: Good location in NY and Boston. Flexible on working from home during bad weather, etc. They seem to take care of our health by arranging some activities and sending us e-advices.
cons: The entire upper management has changed for the worst. Some people that are hired lack people skills and that makes good employees leave. Pathetic health insurance. Public transportation / parking benefits are covered only partially (pretax money).  They don't listen to the employees and just promote the people they need, so the good employees are gone. Entire IT department was gone, and each one of them was just incredible, but they wouldn't get what they needed to exist with life/work balance, things became a nightmare for all.

[pros: Work life balance - DocuSign does a great job at offering a work life balance. You are encouraged to take PTO days. For mental health, physical health, vacation, etc. They encourage you to take them. 

Benefits - The benefits are great. Generous PTO, Company time off the week of Christmas, WFH stipend, Fitness expense, Medical & dental, transportation, etc.
cons: Where do I even start…

The Sales Org is an absolute MESS. The entire C Suite was just wiped out. Directors / upper management quitting left and right. Attrition is HUGE across all roles in the sales org. Quotas are STILL inflated from our COVID peak. Some reps can’t hit the insane quotas so they are living on their base pay, which isn’t even livable. Management does not care about this at all. They ask for feedback but do absolutely nothing with the feedback they receive. 
Because of the high quotas, some reps are out of luck with nearly no shot at promotion. Real, true talent continues to leave because of this. 

Success in the sales org is based SIGNIFICANTLY on the team you are placed. MDRs are placed on teams randomly. Keep this in mind. Success also depends on your manager and your AE. I know some MDRs who have not had a dedicated AE for months because turnover is so high. This affects your ability to do your job successfully & is something you can’t even control. MDRs on certain teams barely do anything, yet are hitting 200%+ of quota because their AE likes them. 

Pay - Base pay is HORRIBLE. No way you can afford to live on base pay if you are located in one of their large hubs. No where close to market rate.

If you started at DocuSign 1-2 years ago your stock isn’t worth anything anymore.

They encourage the use of PTO, but there is no quota forgiveness if you use it.] =",neutral,bad,terrible

Since i was in the Appeals Dept. we were constantly getting yelled at all day and getting calls mistransfered to you and you could get a survey on that.

Oh i don't even think of missing a day, they will give you an Occurrence and you are only allowed 6 Occurrences. If you are passed they you will be terminated, no matter if you have a family issue, sick, or a funeral.

Recruiters are a joke as well, they will tell you that they will work with you and your schedule if you had any particular needs.

[pros: I can't really think of any pros here.
cons: Fitch is run by C players. The fact that C players hire D players to make themselves look good means the whole firm is on the fast track down. There is no career development. You will do all kinds of work that no one will even acknowledge or read. There is no smart thinking here; it is all about following a formula. HR will brag to you about training-don't believe them. The training program is awful. A full 50% of work will be bureaucracy. Promotions are impossible and the selection process is whether or not you are one of the cool kids, just like in high school. Salaries are way below industry standard and raises are rare, except of course for the cool kids. Women and minorities may get hired for an entry level rating job or administrative assistant, but to be promoted you have to be white and male. The top management will tell you they want diversity but look at the numbers. It's like the 1950's.

-My managers were great: helpful, understanding, supportive, and gives appropriate training and constructive criticism. 
-Hours have worked well with my schedule.
cons: All the cons are from the higher-ups. The ""big shots"", basically corporate. 
-In a span of six months they've managed to raise our base productivity per hour from $140 to $160 to now $170. The $170 was after bridal christmas (busiest season of the year) when things got slow. So let me get this straight? We are supposed to add another $10 to our hourly goal during a time where foot traffic significantly declines, say about 60% decline? Hmm...not very logical. And if you go under the base you get written up. Your third write up basically you're fired. Pressure is on. 
-The thing about corporate i.e. the president, board of directors, marketing, district managers (especially district managers), they most likely have never really worked as a stylist or sales associate in DB before. They most likely started as store manager and moved up. Because frankly the company never really hires managers who started as sales associate. Even our Assistant managers are from other companies!!!! We had this one co-worker who has worked as a stylist before, worked as a customer service representative (the front desk agents), and worked in receiving (handling orders and inventory). They even placed her as temporary supervisor when our supervisor quit. So she basically had a crash course in managing. Instead corporate decided to go with outsiders. Needless to say she quit and is now happy with her current job (at least that's what she says and she seemed like it, given what had happen, I believe she is happier where she is now than in DB). 
-So back to DMs never really being stylist before. Well they demand a lot from stylist because they want to not only meet their sales goals but exceed it. Why you ask? For bonuses. Yup, upper management (as well as store manager) get a significant amount of bonuses if they double their sales plans. So basically it trickles down to the stylist to make that happen. And if that does happen, what does the stylists get? Drum roll! A $200 allowance for food for the whole store! Not just the sales team, but the whole store (alterations, receiving, CSR). What no bonus? Oh, no, no, no. Not for the unimportant pawns. Not for the people who truly are the ones who worked their butts off to make it happen. What does the DMs or managers do? They basically come up with ways to train us on making more sales. They make us go to these useless meetings where they just regurgitate information that any common sense sales associate knows. ""Don't ask for the sale, assume the sale"" "" Offer the store card"" ""bring bridesmaids colors to the platform"" ""dress her from top to bottom"" blah blah blah. Things any sales person already knows. Things we already do. Things that actually if you experienced it, never really works. Because why? Because your customer will have already a mindset if they will buy or not. It's not like going to Forever21 to browse. They are making a big decision and most of the time they walk in there knowing they have to think about their decision first. It's actually not about technique, it's Russian Roulette. It's the draw of the luck. You get lucky and you don't. That's it.
-Turnover is high. Not because of getting fired. We try our best to not get fired. But a high turnover because many quit. They find companies who treat them better. Because frankly this company cares only about numero 1. And also their top sales stylist. They build up their top stylist and couldn't care less about everybody else. If lets say you are number 3 sales generator in the store and you occasionally go down a notch or two. Even if you've made your goal majority of the time. Even if your customers rave about what a great consultant you are. Even if you follow all what you are told to do: offer store card, book appointments, always try to up sale the costumer. If you hit the third write up for not hitting the base goal in a span of 6 months. (a pay period is 2 weeks so that's basically 3 pay periods out of 12 pay periods you didn't hit the goal) They don't care. They look down on you. Because why? it's because the potentially means they wouldn't get their bonuses. 
-also why the hell are we competing against the store website? If a bride can get her dress in the website faster, the stylist's hard work is for nothing. You don't even give the requirement in online to input stylist's name or employee number to get the sale. Sure ya you gave that whole code so employees could potentially get the sale from website. But it's not a requirement and the customer can easily decide to enter it and we basically lost a sale. It should be a requirement some how or just eliminate gowns available in-store on the website so the customer has no choice but to buy it through the store. again a way for the company to earn more money buy cutting out the middle man. Trying to skip out of paying commission. 
-Also during bridal christmas they hire a load of ""junior"" stylist who don't make commission but have sales goals of $160 (at the time). So basically we have to compete with more stylist who don't even make commission. Sounds shady huh. My opinion, a way to skip out of giving out commission. And the greediness just keeps on piling up.] =",bad,bad,good

[pros: Worked at the company for several years. Each year progressive got more difficult and miserable. I left due to severe complications this job was causing in my personal life. 

Pros: 
- good health insurance; extremely good health insurance. The only reason I stayed as long as I did. 

- reliable bonus; dependent on the team you’re on. Teams are NOT treated equally. That’s all the pros.
cons: Too many to list: 
- overworked: this company has majority salary positions. Those that work salary have no way to report overtime. You WILL be expected to do work after hours. Every year there is a national user’s conference. Employees are expected to work after hours with no additional pay to meet standard work goals, which are not possible to reach consistently, and the extra duties. They WILL tell you that it’s not legal for them to tell you to work after hours, but YOU WILL BE STRONG ARMED INTO ACCEPTING AT RISK OF RETALIATION 

- Extremely limited internal growth. It’s a “flat company.” The only way you get promoted is through nepotism or backstabbing. 

- HR is entirely inept. They have no clear understanding of US employment law or working conditions. 

- excessive duties outside of stated job duties (if you even get your stated job/job duties in writing. Even if you get it in writing, they have the “right” to change anything, with no notice or feedback from the employee) 

- No inter team communication 

- Working life entirely dictated by your team lead; they can and will make your life miserable if you show any weakness 

- no appreciation for extra work done: nothing you do will ever be good enough to reach the states goals. Additionally, there was the expectation of solving anything that came your way, regardless of the situation. 

- no new hiring; people were quitting left and right. You were expected to pick up the slack no matter what. Any refusal was not acceptable. There were no new hires. 

- Pay: you WILL be underpaid. Starting salaries start at $55k-$60k if you are hired from outside. If you transfer internally, you will be making less than someone who was hired from the outside. For those jobs that travel; there is no over time, no additional pay. You WILL sacrifice your life for peanuts in regards to pay. 

- practicing extremely abusive and gaslighting behavior: this company WILL make you feel like you’re going crazy. DO NOT LET THEM MANIPULATE YOU. THEY WILL TRY AND CONVINCE YOU THAT ANY OF YOUR CONCERNS ARE INSIDE YOUR OWN HEAD. 

- Check the lawsuits for this company before applying.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: They hire just about anyone (although not everyone makes it past the first couple weeks) This is one of the easiest ins to being in a union, and the Teamsters are one of the strongest unions in the country, under the largest private sector contract. You can organize to make a huge difference in working-class conditions, with your hands on one of the key levers of the economy. The Teamsters' health plan is basically the best private insurance coverage you're gonna get—if you make it 9 months in. The job is part-time, but overtime kicks in at 5 hours per shift or on your 6th day per week if you sign up for an extra day. Once you hit 70-workday mark, you get full just-cause protections, management BS is much more constrained by contractual restrictions (and if they don't abide by those, grieve the heck out of them), and there's no production quota in that contract.
cons: Management is only as polite as the local Teamsters (your coworkers) are militant. Until you hit 70 work work days, you're still at-will, and management can fire you for any reason, including if they don't think you're working fast enough under sometimes haphazard conditions, despite such production quotas aren't anywhere in the contract. Keep your head down during the probationary period and take a few overtime days once you've been there a few weeks so that you can get through probation more quickly than they expect. It's hard work. You'll probably get some scrapes and bruises. The sun-baked trailers you load get *hot* during summer day-shifts, and there's no A/C in the hub proper, although management might set up refrigerated trailers for cooldown along with outdoor misting stations. OSHA might or might not actually do anything much about it, so it's up to you and your coworkers to fight for those demands. Find your local Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU) group to help fight for what you all need (but be careful not to let management know that you're doing so pre-seniority).] =",bad,good,good

None of this ever trickles down to the people who actually do the work, promotions were on hold for a year and still are few and far between. This company does not care at all about paying employees a fair wage.

New ideas are  not shared in fear that if it fells accountability is met with humiliation. Software development ideas are stagnant or non existant from within the company.  Competitors technology is always the driving force for software ideas. Upper level managers will belittle the whole team for failure to execute the next best feature against competitors. Mid-level managers talk about amployees to other employees. Development teams work in silos. No one knows what they are developing and what is being deployed.

They offer tuition reimbursement, 401k matches up to 6%, great health benefits (including vision and dental), continued learning via the Oracle University, on site cafe's and gourmet cafeteria, and onsite work out facilities.
cons: It is difficult to move up in the corporation due to the vast competition and politics. Also, if your position can be done cheaper somewhere else they will outsource you and lay you off. I have seem multiple major layoffs in the past 5 years.] =",neutral,good,bad

[pros: You will level up your skills at GR, no matter your position. The tech stack and the complex nature of the data being passed around leads to a lot of tricky problems that need solved. On the product side there are tons of opportunities to drive business initiatives.

[pros: The friendships made with comrades while working in the trenches of a toxic, unprofessional, disrespectful environment working for executives and/or consultants who are either frauds or wholly unqualified for their role and impotent to affect change for the better.  Suffering together forms bonds that should last a lifetime.  As the song says ""if you can make it there, you'll make it anywhere!""
cons: Constant turnover among all ranks but especially in the executive leadership role results in no corporate strategy for growing the wholesale or retail businesses or ability to support the needs and meet the challenges of the business.  Mistakes made last season or last year are repeated over and over.  Growth opportunities (accessories, bags, small leather goods, evening wear, holiday gifts, footwear, mens etc.) are ignored.  An Israeli boys club runs the company, Hebrew is the main language in the office and Kabbalah is preached to employees in weekly meetings at which attendance is required by those invited.  Employees are STRONGLY encouraged to celebrate Jewish Holidays with senior staff when invited.  Senior personnel are hired, then fired at alarming rates, none lasting more than 6, 9 months at the longest.  People who are fired or leave on their own are rarely replaced, leaving more work for those remaining, there are more open desks than occupied in all offices.  Sexual harassment is tolerated while bullying (and screaming at) of mid and entry level employees by senior and executive leadership is rampant. Mid and entry level personnel are hired for one job, then moved to others at whim. Reviews?  Never.  Consultants?  Absolutely, the more the better, regardless of qualifications or capability.  Company Moral?  Bad and getting worse.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Flexible scheduling, seeing and getting to know regular customers. And on a local store level I very much enjoyed most of the people I worked with. Weekly paychecks. Lots of partnerships with local animal rescues. We even were able to donate food and toys and the like to animal shelters.
cons: No training for how to care for the animals that they sold or how to communicate care needs to the customer. We had a customer that we suspected was abusing the animals she purchased from us and when we brought up the concern with the higher ups we were told to continue to sell to her.

We are forced to sell items that are harmful or not good for the animals that they are advertised for (ie betta tanks that are .5 gallons or bird cages that are WAY too small). 

The pay is awful even for store manager and ASM. Cashiers are paid minimum wage. Key Carriers were paid 50 cents an hour more when they were the manager on duty only, as an ASM I only made a dollar more an hour than the cashiers. 

Only the store manager and ASM were given full time status. Everyone else was only supposed to be at 28 hours or less and the management got in trouble if people went over that. We were only allowed to schedule so many hours a week which resulted in us being short staffed most of the time

As management we were expected to have stock out, greeters, POGs, paperwork and a whole host of everything else done but we weren’t given the man hours to do so. We were constantly in trouble because we couldn’t get our work done because we could only scheduled two people per shift.

The benefits are a joke - health insurance took up almost half of the weekly pay!] =",bad,terrible,excellent

[pros: SAP is dedicated to providing flexibility, support and transparency for its employees. working hours are left to the employee and not reviewed; children can be brought to work (there is a big 'playroom' which allows the parent to work while the child plays); hearty lunches are paid for; there are free drinks; feedback is given on demand, progress happens quickly (I got my first raise 4 weeks after I started working); there is an active social community & quite a few Events & initiatives (I participated in a run during my third week at the office and participated in onboarding events); working from home is definitely possible (this could depend on your boss, I'm not sure); you can get the best of the best regarding Technology (PC, phone, mouse, etc.); the Company is very international and open to people of all nationalities. I almost feel there are more foreigners here than locals. :)
cons: This is a big corporation and I find that this is reflected in the interactions (or lack thereof) with people outside of your own team. If I don't say hello while getting a coffee or elevator simultaneously with someone else, they are unlikely do so. Sure you can make friends outside of your team, but it takes quite a bit of effort.] =",neutral,excellent,excellent

cons: Sr level management hired because of who they know or who they're related to. Creates resentment and a disconnect in the branch. The company underwent a massive change when the former CEO left, after his retirement they shifted from an employer who cares about the employees to an employer who cares about profit only. This is ironic as their profits and shares are both down with huge loan losses. They also allow bullying and when it's brought up to HR the employee is blamed because it causes work.

cons: You may struggle a lot in the beginning until you get familiar with the environment. If your manager is a good one, your life will be easy but it is not always the case.

[pros: If you teach yourself the job, you'll be OK. And if you are in with the Higher ups, you'll be set. Just watch out, they do a reduction in force every February.
cons: you will not be able to move into a higher position unless someone dies OR you are liked by all managers. You will be worked to the bone and only be told how the managers did good  to achieve what needed to be done. There is NEVER any compensation for the long hours you put in. MAYBE a vendor buck! if you are not liked, the managers do not hide that fact. If you are a temp you really need to careful. This company has a revolving door and they do not need an excuse to let you go. There is never any room for improvement. even if you suggest something to manager or directors that could possibly better the company,it will never be YOUR idea.  they look at you like you have two heads, fire you for the suggestions, BUT they still implement the suggestion under their terms to make themselves look good. the senior management is deceitful, they even go after leads and areas managers just to save their own hides. The director also cannot make a decision unless he/she follows up with her favorite mangers, (who need to be fired). If you like to be lied to then this is the company to work for. They have the lowest starting rate, can't keep their customers happy, but STILL manage to blame the employees instead of looking at themselves. If they didn't have a reduction in force (letting go veterans of the company) EVERY February, then maybe they would be able to keep their customers happy, instead of bringing in new people who consistently screw up.

[pros: They raised the pay to $15 an hour

Don't be fooled by the extra pay raise because there is now more red tape you have to go through to get anything done. 

You can get written up for pretty much anything.

Everyone's stressed out and many people have two jobs, especially in the prepared foods department. 

Don't work in prep foods. You're doing the most work and getting paid as much as the dishwasher. 

The hours are variable and not enough notice for getting your schedule. If you have a family,  expect not to see them often as the hours are early morning (6 am) or late evening  (until 11 or midnight)

Short breaks and unpaid 30 minute lunch. Not enough rest and digest time. 

A lot of people don't speak English so there can be a communication barrier which makes it difficult to work as a team.

cons: Very low compensation compared to other similar positions in the industry. You will never (emphasize never) receive competitive raises. Management is terrible. Turnover is very high and nothing is done to correct this. People at the bottom are viewed as replaceable. Goals are unrealistic so nobody is motivated to try to reach them. Even if they are reached, bonuses and raises are SO laughable (less than inflation), if they even come at all.

[pros: Solid company with high visibility and good reputation.
cons: Pay has been decreased for hourly leaders, pay for entry level workers is low and requirements from same workers has increased. A High Peformance culture with a low wage translates to high turnover. Work-life balance is diminishing due to increasing demands.  I've been very happy with the company in the past 20+ years, adapted and overcome many changes and challenges. Now it seems like no end to what is required, more challenging than ever to keep team (and self) motivated when pay is low, demands are high. Employees can't ignore that forever. Salaried members are now working year round like its the holidays. So I've sacrificed time at holidays with my family, now I'll need to do it all year long in order to meet my objectives and satisfy the requirements of my position. New 2014 PTO replacing vacation, sick time and personal holiday reduced compensation by giving team members less time off.  The bonus structure that was implemented a few years back reduces bonus for store managers too. CEO said he wanted ""more from the core"" well, that could leave you hollow.] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: Weekly pay. That’s it. Seriously
cons: The only benefit to working for a company like this is that they pay weekly. Other than that, if you’re an internal employee, it’s easy to see how things truly are.

This company will hire sex offenders and place them in companies that hire other former offenders. You don’t have to be a genius to know how that will end. One coworker had several complaints against her in the three weeks I was there, but she managed to stay because she was salaried.

[pros: - You get to learn (and appreciate) a lot about manufacturing. So the next time you buy a computer you can have more empathy for the people that worked hard to get you that product.

- After one works there for three months, it takes something incredible to get one fired. I'm talking breaking economic sanctions, purposely setting property on fire, etc..

And somehow, that's a pro.
cons: - The higher-ups ""talk"" about believing in work-life balance, but it's just that: talk. 
- It is far better to be ""seen"" working then the actual results.
- Work hours and incredibly horrendous. 9 to 9/10p is common, and for some reason the CEO has the ability to take note of this.
- There is little to no training (and the little bits of ""training"" consists of ferrying new-hires to unrelated departments for three months and doing unskilled labor - regardless if you are salaried or not, so no overtime if you are).
- Middle and upper management cares more about turning a profit than the quality of product that leaves the warehouse.
- Shouting matches between department heads is all too common. It's like watching bad soap operas, except you get paid to watch them.
- The titles people hold are just that: titles. Most - if not all - of the people in professional roles hold titles that they are not even remotely qualified for.
- Seniority (and sucking up) are sure-fire ways of getting promoted, not by merit.
- CEO is surrounded by yes-men, so change happens at a glacial pace.
- Home to some of the most unprofessional ""professionals"" I've ever worked with.
- Incredibly inefficient work system and stupidly bureaucratic. The CEO has to sign-off on every little thing that - combined by the fact that only God or the CEO himself can fire you - people rarely report catastrophic inefficiencies or much-needed changes to the existing system.
- Hourly employees can potentially make 50% more than salaried employees since they receive overtime and work the same hours salaried employees do.
- It is better to ship broken products to customers on time - and then blame other departments when the customer returns them - than it is to spend time making quality plans.
- The amount of inefficiency and disorganization at the middle management level is astounding. And there is little hope for any sort of change.

- There is a reason for the high-turnover rate. Highly skilled people are lured in by the idea of working in a Silicon Valley tech company, only to be swallowed whole by the:
    1. Low wages
    2. Resistance to change
    3. Politics (spies reporting to the CEO on bad behavior, inter-departmental bickering and finger pointing, etc.)
So when they figure out the secrets of this place and what goes on behind the glass doors, they either:
    4. Stay low, suck up, and collect their easy money until retirement.
    5. Learn what they need to learn and jump ship to a better company (which, honestly, anywhere would do).
    6. Work themselves to death/alcoholism/former shell of a what they once were.

- God help you if you don't speak a word of mandarin. There are instances where people in the middle (and even upper) management level using Google Translate to translate mandarin to English when messaging English-speaking customers.
    - Actually, I take that back. Be glad you don't speak mandarin. That way, you can keep your head low and stay out of the politics (see 3.)
- Incredibly unfair to those not familiar with US labor laws regarding exempt employee status and being given work appropriated for hourly workers.
- HR is as ineffective and powerless as a wet napkin.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Caring for, and interacting with animals is the main appeal of this job for me, and I enjoy helping pet parents provide the best care for their animal friends.

Petco has some great company values, and I like they work we do to raise money for animal-related charities and local shelters.
cons: The training system, computers, and registers are all outdated. This was probably the worst and least comprehensive training I've ever gone through. There are technical issues with the registers and computers on a daily basis.

My store manager is possibly the worst manager I've ever had. He cuts corners, belittles employees, only posts our schedules a few days in advance, misquotes company policies, and isn't great with guests.

It's tough to care for these animals every day and see the ones who aren't purchased start to deteriorate or go stir crazy cooped up in what are only supposed to be temporary enclosures. We tell guests how to best care for their pets, but don't always follow our own advice. Animal care suffers under poor training and employees encouraged to take shortcuts.

[pros: I loved my time at Avercast. Everyone is very friendly and works hard.
While I was there, the development team had shrunk considerably, but that only meant that we were closer than ever.
If you are a student at BYU-I, I highly recommend this internship. Yes, it is unpaid, but you can get an internship scholarship through the university that should cover all expenses. You don't have to move, which can be very bothersome.
I learned a lot, and not just about Software Engineering specifically. I learned about software architecture and DevOps, and about management. 
I wouldn't trade this internship for the world because of the experience that I gained and the people I was fortunate to meet.
cons: I won't talk about the lack of compensation here. I knew very well that it was an unpaid internship before I started, and so did anyone else who has left a review on this site. Complaining about it is a sign of immaturity.
The only real Con that I have is that there was a lack of attention from upper management, although it might have been due to personal reasons on their part.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

cons: This is a franchise location with no benefits, no paid time off, no vacation days and you will have to work holiday if it falls on your schedule. This property where I work at is run down and gets a lot of complaint from the guests, which will make you or break you just like boot camp. If you can survive and learn here you can make it anywhere. The owners have not put any money into fixing it up making are job harder. There just running it into the ground until they can't squeeze any money out of it. Then they will drop it on some other poor sap. When they took over this property a couple years ago they raised the prices from $35.99 to $50.99 and did no improvement to the place it at all. When I started working here two years ago we were selling 50-60 rooms a night. Lately we're lucky if we get 15-20 rooms, which means they will cut our hours.

[pros: This is a very, very deeply entrenched conservative Boomer environment and culture, think business practices from the 1970s. SO if you have no ambition left WHATSOEVER and are ready to float along and ride the Boomer wave, you will LOVE it here.
cons: Not an organization that operates based on reason, facts, logic, or external market trends. C-Suite is seriously entrenched with an outdated culture of values and business models created decades ago. It's a very weird and awkward place for Millennials. This place is like a retirement community. C-Suite is more interested in protecting and preserving their heritage or hiring people that will conform and tow the status-quo. The vast majority of the management are Boomers, who are majority floaters, that receive every other Friday off, and collectively do the work of the minority of key talent. If you join this organization, and you are young, ambitious, key talent, etc. then expect to be underpaid to market, undervalued, and also have the workload of a dozen Boomers at the company who are all laughing the way to the bank. I recommend looking elsewhere, as virtually every other financial company in Canada will pay you a higher base salary. The company has invested in a massive new commercial office expansion, yet do not increase wages accordingly with market conditions, nor an individuals performance, or macroeconomic conditions like inflation, etc. It is very clear to me that the company values a new parking space that is being built (and will likely never be used) over increasing my wages. One can predict what their official ""return to office"" policy may look like based on the Boomer culture and the build of this massive new office building in Guelph. But, the C-Suite of course portrays an aura of caring deeply about employees via carefully curated communications. The Boomers eat up this nonsense as it's all they have ever known, bending to the every desire and want of the other Boomer above. All the high performer Millennials are left quitting and scratching their heads on what a weird experience that was...] =",bad,terrible,excellent

[pros: Great associates-- not fellow managers 
Lovely guests- that have no idea of the actual practices of the store they are spending there hard earned money in.
I really cannot think of anything that stands out as a PRO for Ulta Beauty.
cons: Everything!!
Absolutely no Gratis for anyone other than our GM she took a big Ulta orange bag of gratis once a couple weeks basically full to the top of free product - never shared any and she didn't even wear the required mascara and foundation we were supposed to wear every shift ... so why all the gratis for someone whom wears NO makeup??! Very selfish !!!
No training!! I mean NONE
MY GM was the most condescending hypocritical person
I've ever met. She was extremely rude to fellow associates as well as customers. She 
would flat out accuse of stealing and then when the guests would ask her what her name was she would lie and make up a different name - and I was 'training' wow !! Great role model.. right??
Nothing is what they say you will be doing as an MSC. 
I was not included in any of the pow wows the managers would have - even though I was considered a manager .
I was told how much my GM hated her boss our District Mgr - ( directly from my GM)what a great way for me to not be able to form my own idea about our DM.
Very unprofessional GM she would literally scream at her associates in front of customers . 
I saved the best for last ...  Ulta is the most racist company I have EVER worked for . My associate manager and General Manager would follow and radio us to watch all black guests - because as soon as they walked in they were labeled 'suspicious' I would ask what did they do to be labeled 'suspicious' oh.. they're black ! WHAT??? I would never participate in actions like that and def would not associate myself with a company like that. I am actually taking to social media regarding this issue - as it is very close and important to my heart - that I don't just let this go.
Really think hard about working for this company !!! Why do you think they are always hiring?? Because they can't keep anyone employed longer than a couple 
months .] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: It is a pro only if you are management or HR production associates  are not part of the team and communication is a big issue. They push quantity over quality.
cons: Production associates are afraid to speak up because HR and management targets them if they do. They claim they want passionate, courageous people who will speak up if something is wrong but, when there is no communication, that is hard to do. Production associates do not recommend friends and family to work there because it has gone downhill, with bad management and HR on the floor. Upper management does not seem to care, they assume it will turn around on its own. They can not get experienced production associates to be PLs, supervisors or managers because, HR asks them to target certain production associates so, they take them from, Target, McDonalds ect. then tell associates to go to them when they have an issues. They have temps training temps because the training department is so bad, and nobody speaks up anymore because they say, it does not matter, and it will just get you targeted and fired. Most temps start and leave quickly when they find out things such as, you get fired before you can retire, and floor management and HR think anyone can be a class 3 solder in 6 weeks. 2 to 3 years, more like it. So, Not true but, company runs a lot of class three boards. You do the math.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: - The company possess a very structured graduate program for all discipline types (engineering, HR, IT, Finance, etc). In my opinion, you wont experience a better IT graduate program.
- The company really values work life balance, they don't want you sticking around till late in the evening to prove you are a good worker. Sometimes if I worked late my line manager would ask why and then insist that I pack up and go home.
- Everyone is there to support one another -  you will rarely run into an individual that isn't a team player. I've never worked with such great people, and that statement applies to individuals from all different departments spanning from trading to retail and from project managers, business analyst all the way up to VPs and senior managers.
- The benefits are great and the pay is industry standard. For London graduates are on a pretty sweet pay package, although not as much as the banks. But then again, the work life balance at Shell is SO MUCH BETTER than if you were at a bank or consulting firm.
cons: - Depending on the price of oil and gas the company will restructure certain departments like HR and IT. By restructure I mean offer voluntary severance packages in an attempt to reduce the workforce and save money. But if you are good and have a good Individual Performance Rating then you will be fine. But for the ""average joes"" or those that were rated poorly by a rubbish manager, goodluck!
- Sometimes HR will push a graduate within a team that is clearly not mean't to host graduates. HR really needs to make sure that graduate are getting the right level of support and management and that they are in a role that isn't going to crush their soul.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

[pros: Compensation is decent. There are good, hard working folks who are pleasurable to work with.
cons: Webtrends is going on ten years of a five year plan. It's the plan of a company that has lost ground as the analytics field has grown and has curious plans to move forward. A strong adherence to the group think that its own marketing department peddles is required for survival. 
A new CEO who thinks he has the plan and means to turn things around in a few years does not inspire confidence. 
The lessons of the Great Analytics Company Sell Off of 2011, of which Webtrends was not a participant, gives one a reason to pause. Therein lies many of the answers. The current stated intent to become a publicly traded company is delusional at best.] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: Keep showing up and you have a job for life that pays better than a ""greeter"" at Walmart.
cons: Fancy yourself a shooting star? Motivated by career advancement? Love state-of-the-art equipment? At Hormel your annual review is rated as follows: 2B;3- (your a day one employee or you just don't have a clue). 3 (way to go your a C student). 3+ (you must be a genius private pile), 4,5 ratings aren't available unless your the CEO's kid. Top performing level 12 supervisors with a 3+ rating might earn $500 more in the form of a bonus than a 3- rated, foaming at the mouth, brain dead supervisor. You'll watch failed upper management get demoted into lead supervisor positions so they can reach retirement.

[pros: The company cares. Plain and simple. They give back - over $1million to date- and the company is only 5 years old. They have added many programs to enhance the brand and reduce workload on the team (scanners, traffic counters, a bonus program, health plans, 401k, a comprehensive training program, smaller districts, and more in last few months). Almost every intern has been hired on after graduation, and most every entry level associates have seen growth and promotion due to  the company's rapid growth. It is hard to find a company that provides that much growth in such a short time. 

All associates have a vital role in volunteering and choosing how to spend donations. They sky is limit on good ideas and the company likes to hear all the good ideas and encourages sharing photos and experiences the team have. The teams are encouraged to share entries from their prayer request books and inspirational experiences they have in store each day.  The strongest store teams are the most involved in give back programs and community involvement. Prayer chain is a part of the daily routine and often company-wide prayer requests are sent out so the company can join in lifting up team members or members of the communities near the stores. Where else does a company celebrate this unification?
cons: Any growing company will have hurdles, and Altar'd State is not exception. However, I have never worked any where more willing to change to make the company better. It is not only about the bottom line, but also about the journey and the outcome. The company spends most days calculating how they are giving back to communities and individuals. THAT is hard to find in retail. Growth is hard, but they have added many initiatives to make the growth manageable. That being said, there are a lot of tasks to make the environment better and more unique. It is hard to be strong visually, emotionally, and operationally. But, that is the company mission. This strong mission makes succeeding more difficult. 

Altar'd State is fast-paced and you are held accountable for performance. If you aren't willing to make decisions and stand by them, AS may not be a good fit.] =",excellent,excellent,none

[pros: -Discounts on rent if you live at an Equity property.

-You work with some really great people.
cons: -High Turnover: There is an unbelievable amount of turnover in the leasing offices. Upper management doesn't seem to care since they'll end up paying the new employee less than someone who's been there longer.  About half the leasing consultants I started with in training left by the time I hit 6 months.

-Understaffing: Even with high turnover, they do not fill positions quickly (sometimes months) which leaves an already understaffed office with very little support.  I've seen them take advantage and completely burn out so many great employees to the point of quitting. 

-Work/Life Balance: You barely get any holidays off and most employees work weekends (even managers)

-Manipulative management: Community and Regional managers know how to manipulate their employees when making decisions about their careers (transferring communities, promotions, quitting, etc.) and are always only looking out for themselves and their own careers.] =",neutral,bad,bad

[pros: This company was fantastic before it was Staples. The former 'Corporate Express' had a true grasp on the business, its people and the Australian market in general.
There are currently very few pros under the Staples banner apart from some outstanding Associates still working there at the lower levels.
cons: It is questionable if the newly injected senior management (US origin) know what they are doing.
Promotions are seemingly awarded to the most subservient employees which exacerbates the continued poor results. There is little to no interest in staff innovating, challenging the status quo or questioning the ideas of senior management. Anyone working in this organization remains employed by not question management decisions. 

Recently a Senior Manager was appointed in WA. Previously, this Associate had a history of HR related issues whilst in his former Management role, however was promoted because he would tow the company line. This is testament to the continuing poor judgement of senior leaders (who knew of his questionable history) making the easiest decision and not the best decision.
 
This coupled with poor leadership and questionable sales direction has bred a culture of instability and distrust among staff within the office. Associates are leaving every day and not being replaced. Not a good sign.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Best in class product
Incredible resources / collateral for sales
Lots of opportunity for penetration in a competitive market (especially smb and mid market)
cons: Like with any organization, there are weird cliques. I had the unfortunate experience of being told verbally I was working for one person, and then after being given a verbal offer was transitioned to work for a woman that is legitimately a miserable human being. From day one, condescending, eye rolling, telling me it was an awful / weird onboarding experience. From there it was essentially “working me out” as they call it in big tech. People talking trash about me to my face or in code right next to me. Lured me from cushy gig at a competitor with RSUs and cash sign on, only to give me a 46/100 on a sales simulation I had already done twice to get hired. Totally subjective, made it very clear they thought it was a mistake hiring me during the very first week. “Open honest direct” is a part of the culture, yet it was more or less sarcasm, condescension, and high school antics for me for 90 days. Family first, relationships matter etc, yet some cat lady who doesn’t know how to manage people, who walks around looking like she hasn’t slept in a week telling me “this isn’t for everybody” daily. She was in the office maybe 10 times during my “tenure” there, yet this is an inside sales job?

[pros: One of the best things about Acquirent is the liberating sales environment. There is a lot of opportunity to be yourself and carry your own responsibilities without having someone peeking over your shoulder or asking for sales pipeline updates everyday. You really do have an enormous opportunity to learn about how sales' cycles work and gain enormous amounts of knowledge. The culture is strongly built upon having a good attitude and putting in effort, which WON'T go unnoticed. Employees can get to know the partners on a personal basis and have one-on-one time with them. The amount of transparency that company offers, in terms of how it makes money and what its strategic plans are, is very unique. There is a TON of opportunity in this industry as well and Acquirent shows it has the right type of leadership to capitalize on that opportunity. Acquirent does truly care about its people, there is little no zero office politics here.
cons: Acquirent has a difficult time forecasting Sales reps' commission potential especially with new clients; I have seen several people leave the organization because real commissions fell well short of what was forecasted for them. There also needs to be more opportunity for professional advancement within the organization itself. The company struggles with finding the most assertive and skilled professionals but struggles to keep the talent it does find anyway because that talent can make more money elsewhere OR sees no opportunity for internal advancement. The company also needs to be more structured with its performance reviews so that employees can see how they've advanced beyond their sales. There is also nothing formalize for earning a base raise.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

[pros: The pay was better than most studios. Working with other assistants your age was also cool!
cons: This studio runs on fear. HR has a habit of doing nothing with employee complaints and they would rather just pay people off to quit. Nevertheless, there are several departments with toxic management meanwhile the assistants work their butts off and get things done only to be scolded 24/7. There's no work life balance, and there's never accountability for upper management even though they are the cause to the unhappiness in the company. Oh, and expect your overtime to be cut since there's so many politics here. Execs know you're busting in hours, but will stay silent to make sure their department doesn't get into any trouble. It's a trickle down effect where amateur, in denial directors and VPs are scared to stand up to the unprofessional and childish heads of their department, yet they eventually become as unhappy and toxic. You feel so drained at the end of the day, where making movies or shows is far from your passion anymore. The true definition of unhealthiness and delusion.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

He treats the employees with respect and listens to what they say although for now what he can do is limited by his title we all hope one day he will be leading the way and we hope he doesn't change.
cons: Front line employees stuck in the past. Most have terrible attitudes due to lack of knowledge of other companies. Employees are angry that they have start times and scheduled break times and are no longer allowed to just come and go as they please. Last time I checked this is how every company operates.

[pros: Wow!  As I write this I realize that I can't think of a reason to work at Saks.

I should have worked for the brand directly as THAT TEAM was helpful, nurturing and supportive.  Oh!!  The staff in asset protection were FANTASTIC and took the job very seriously!

[pros: - Effort on infrastructure modernization

- The NY office is nice

- Smart, congenial colleagues

- Good WLB

Really has potential to be a great place to work if not for some of the glaring negatives.
cons: - Repeated pattern of paying lip service to try to cover big blunders in decisions. There are currently a number of critical modernization initiative the company is attempting to undergo, and there is very little accountability and continued missed deadlines. When this happens, mgmt finds a scapegoat (or multiple) to blame, makes very little process efficiency improvements, and then continues down the same route. This goes on until a point of no return, at which point leaders will simply bail on the project altogether.

- NYC mgmt is truly sub-par. They are rude, 'cliquey', and aggressive. They are not invested in growth of employees, do not recognize good work where it's being done, and have no interest in building a respectful office culture. So much playing politics and continuing to reward poor-performing 'yes-men' that it's nauseating.

- The sales pitch of the office is that it has a startup vibe with the backing of a large financial firm. This could not be further from the truth. TRP is just like any other antiquated financial firm, and as such, focuses heavily on hiring cheap contracted labor instead of FTE's whom they cycle through consistently to show senior mgmt that they're making people changes when deadlines are blown through.

- Horrible culture of intimidation. Numerous issues have been brought up to mgmt, and they were ignored (and then you're put on the 'naughty list').] =",terrible,terrible,none

[pros: BDC for tech cloud.

- Great colleagues, young environment with people from many different places, easy to make connections.  
- You don’t have to work really hard (this job made me really lazy). 
- Realistic targets.
cons: - The commission is an absolute joke. They do not even pay you close to what you've been told. The company in general wants to spend as little money as possible on employees.
- Business Development is not aligned with Sales at all, they work independent from each other and do not collaborate. 
- Didn't feel like I had a purpose most of the time. 
- The relocation package is not great. For example, they offer only ridiculous expensive temporary apartments for your relocation (4000€ for one month). You have to pay back the relocation package if you leave within 9 months (pay back 100%) or 18 months (pay back 50%).  
- Continuous changes that affect your day-to-day work and decisions made by management just based on numbers.
- You are really done with learning and developing after 7-8 months, the job becomes really repetitive. Not a lot of growth/learning opportunities.

It’s an okay first job and pretty easy to get hired (in my opinion). Just don’t spend too much in the relocation package, in case you want to leave. There are many better opportunities out there.] =",terrible,neutral,excellent

Will cut people at the slightest dip in the market and now that the market tanked due to Covid, they reduced everyone's pay without even attempting to make it to Q2.
