[pros: I would say the pros are everything you learn from AT&T. You learn just as a rep how to do back office, set up merchandise displays, inventory count, sales calls, setting up events, handling customers outside of the store with apartments. You also learn time management professionally and pretty much do your own training and train other employees. Assisting in closing sales with coworkers.
cons: Impossible deadlines for sales with the traffic coming into the store, ridiculous coaching that makes you feel like you are nothing even after closing a sale with a TV and adding 5 new lines with protection. You just never feel appreciated for everything you do and put effort in and promises of moving up into management and do all the management work and never go anywhere. Oh and never get used to your managers I worked there for 4 years and had around 15 different managers in that time frame.] =",excellent,bad,bad

[pros: The employees are great to work with.
Supportive culture amongst teams.
Benefits are good.
cons: Much like most of this industry, 

Allocations are never realistic for your study duties.

Be prepared to work extremely hard and have a burnout or two. We all expect to work for our wages but you really have to be intentional to set boundaries and enforce them. Or work/life balance will not exist - even though it’s heavily promoted. But the reality is that you are just more often than not over allocated. 

Internal application process needs some work.

[pros: Work from home is permanent.
cons: They lack any sort of decent training when hired, they preach their pillars but don’t follow them, too many people touch the financials you work on, creative accounting, they let the “clients” dictate their financials even if not correct with standard accounting, pay is garbage, expected to work 55 hours plus, they don’t care about anything but the bottom line.

[pros: It really is a struggle to find one.
cons: Worst place I have ever worked. Archaic systems in place and no HR. Zero support systems in place to motivate people toward progression hence why the turnover of staff is so high. It's a shame seeing as it's such an old and well known company that they actually have nothing in place for staff satisfaction and everyone is kind of just hanging on a by a thread. Micro managers who think because they've worked there a long time they own the place when actually they don't have a clue and are projecting insecurities onto new employees with fresh, exciting ideas (who eventually realise there is way better out there after a while and leave, hence turnover rate again)! Best decision was leaving. Trust me look elsewhere. Do not work here if looking for any kind of career progression or somewhere to 'grow'.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

They don’t tell you this until orientation but you’ll most likely have to work in set assembly without choice. You can ever get “crewed” to set assembly and lose pay.  They go down the list in seniority offering for people to go home and keep 3-7 people. Then find a BUNCH of work and breath over their necks for them to get it done.

[pros: - Great benefits (paid gym memberships, paid phone plans, lots of spiffs/ opportunities to make more $$, great culture, progressive leaders, paid lunch, hybrid/ remote work, company provided equipment, ALMOST never ending sales education courses )
- good compensation plan, but this is changing. 
- relatively easy duties
- (depends heavily on manager you have and who you speak with) Higher ups do not micro manage your time.
cons: - Almost immediately after I came on with the company (1-2 months), they decided to change everything. It sort of feels like I was ""bait and switched"" as the company did not really loop anybody in on coming changes and just whipped it out on a timeline and told everyone to get ready to adjust.
-As an inbound SDR, we went from having 3 territories/managers in the US to having 6 territories/managers... including 3-4 of which are brand new to the company. They are great managers, very uplifting; but it feels wrong to change everything and have entirely new management without prepping your team for it...
-With the above being said, we have a monthly quota which feels like it has become nearly impossible to hit with the new territory changes. We went from getting anywhere from 12-20+ new leads daily, to consistently having MAYBE 5 throughout the entire day. Management has also decided to not change the monthly quotas even though they essentially took away all of our leads , and hired significantly more SDRs ; you can look across the board and see little people are succeeding the way they did prior to this change.
- management has also decided to change the pay plan (to my knowledge this is not set in stone quite yet) to effect you poorly if you are under succeeding; again, even though they took away all of our leads and doubled the amount of SDR. Though the pay plan will effect you positively if you exceed quota, this just is not the case for many of us at this time unfortunately. 
- Speaking to a few SDR throughout my side of the company, we are all being told to be patient, more leads will come and then given lists of old leads (80% have already said no many times or purchased another product) to go through. Management acknowledges the problem, but continues to do nothing about it. 
-Since things are remote there can be a lack of communication, a lot of workers are on different time zones which creates a big delay. 
- Sometimes there is not a clear answer on how to deal with something, and even management doesnt know how to deal with it.. Such as contacting different portions of the company (international teams for example) 
- While there are alot of resources to reference and learn from, the company does not do a good job of informing you of the other products we offer even though they want you to refer leads to other products if they dont fit the one you sell. 
- some systems they integrate with (like our phone/ click to call and customer activity apps) absolutely STINK! Constantly crashing, not working, making it very hard to do your job.] =",excellent,neutral,excellent

[pros: They are the largest security risk company in the world. You will learn a lot from your coworkers, who reside all across the globe and come from a variety of different backgrounds. The work you do on a daily basis is meaningful and will give you valuable experience.

The benefits package is nice
cons: GardaWorld's upper management is perceived as hostile, including the CEO S. Cretier. There was a lack of transparency about the acquisition, meanwhile dozens of employees were let go or left for other opportunities, making it feel like a sinking ship. 

GardaWorld has been involved in several high profile scandals, just look at the Tampa Bay Times articles. GardaWorld has a predatory mindset and will acquire smaller companies and raid their technology while ousting those who created the tech in the first place. The company seems to be much more focused on reaching certain financial goals rather than customer satisfaction. 

The products GardaWorld distributed prior to the acquisition were inferior to its competitors. Some managers are ignorant about what the intel team produces, despite being the company's backbone. No sense of company culture, as there are no social events and the environment is tense from uncertainty about the acquisition.] =",bad,bad,excellent

[pros: Flexible schedule and work from home, 40 HRS A WEEK MONDAY TO FRIDAY . 401k benefits, Medical/ Dental.
cons: I worked as an IA Agent/Customer Service Rep for Education Dynamics LLC for two years. While there were some positive aspects to the job, overall, I cannot recommend this company. I have some serious concerns about the company's practices. Speaking up is not encouraged, and if you do, you may be punished. This alone creates a toxic work environment that is not conducive to healthy communication. In addition, there are ethical concerns with the company's business practices. Customers often fill out job applications online, but these applications are never submitted, making it feel like we were scamming people. The company continuously hires, which should raise some red flags. Communication between employees was poor, and I often felt unsure about my role within the company. Shady practices were prevalent, and upper management seemed manipulative and untrustworthy. The HR department was also two-faced, which made it difficult to raise concerns about questionable actions taking place. The company has a high rating on BBB,(A+) but this seems rigged and does not reflect the reality of the work environment. Raises were not available, and there was no review and evaluation plan that indicated any raises would be offered, which made it difficult to plan my future with the company. Promotions were not handled appropriately, and there was no stability. However, the flexible schedule and work from home option were beneficial, and the 40-hour workweek from Monday to Friday with no weekends was appreciated. Overall, I would not recommend Education Dynamics LLC as an employer due to the ethical concerns, poor communication, and manipulative upper management.] =",terrible,bad,excellent

There's really ZERO appreciation from corporate, on any level. They want you to shut up and work harder and faster whilst they sit back and make BILLIONS of dollars and RECORD profits from the pandemic.
No hazard pay. No protection, (unless we are being visited by someone from the health department or Eco lab, then they make us all scurry and pretend we do it all the time. I refuse to play along 😒).

Remote environment.

-lack of work/life balance. KPIs that are expected of you are unrealistic to achieve in even a 50-60 hour work week. Every single day felt like an emergency if something didn't get done immediately. I came from a fast-paced top-tier tech company, and this is next level (in a bad way)
-poor benefits compared to other top-tier tech companies. 
-no culture. Seems like high turnover rates and multiple acquisitions contribute to this
-since Handy, Angi, and HA merged, the tech problems they have with merging all systems are laughable. Be prepared to have multiple email addresses and to have to work out of gmail and outlook.

[pros: Great portfolio of products. Work from home (for some).
cons: Their talk of 'diversity', 'inclusion', and 'purpose' are a carefully curated business decision. When tasked with living up to the values that they preach , Leadership comes up staggeringly short. During the last 18 months, multitudes of dedicated employees have been outsourced to India, or replaced with recent college grads at a MUCH lower salary. 

The previous Supply Chain Head opted to close offices and destroy lives, leaving hundreds of families with employment / medical benefit / financial insecurity during a global pandemic. While those impacted were forced to sign non-compete agreements in order to feed their families, he was able to take his wealth of insider knowledge...to Unilever's largest competitor.

[pros: Healthcare is an interesting field. Most people are nice. Also, if you are bad at your job, you have many, many years ahead of you here.
cons: -	Strata hires young professionals right out of college who have no experience in the workplace, pays them below market for their skills, does nothing to nurture their professional growth beyond getting them a LinkedIn Learning account, then lets them walk away when they're ready to take on a more lucrative, challenging position at another healthcare or technology company. 
-	Those of us who stick around (whether on sheer optimism or self-sabotage) are left holding the bag and managing the work of 2+ roles outside of our own, at lower-than-average salaries to begin with.
-	Leadership does nothing beyond whatever makes their own teams look good or what will stroke their own egos. There is no public accountability for leadership’s decisions and leaders often meet and talk in circles around problems for years. 
-	Strata talks a lot about how it may not have adequate pay, but it does have culture. “Culture"" meaning milquetoast white people patting themselves on the back for a workplace built on Midwestern niceness and intermural sports teams.
-	HR does everything it can to pay itself lip service (bragging about free volunteer and mental health days, sending employees a candle in the mail, creating a diversity council out of inexperienced, unqualified employees...) but doesn't accept feedback from team members looking to improve things and have skirted around these issues for years when addressing the company.
-	I have stayed at Strata for over 5 years waiting for the better future just around the corner. Because of leaders committed to making middle-of-the-road decisions, an HR team hellbent on getting people back into the office instead of building true culture, and an environment of endless meetings that could have been emails and emails that could have been Slack messages and Slack messages that could have been a thought left alone in someone's head...I know I'm not the only one looking elsewhere.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: The people are really outstanding, you can make lasting relationships with good, intelligent people. There is also a lot of autonomy in scheduling (although you end up having to work around other people and plant schedules a lot) but aside from that you can work the hours that you want to
cons: Pretty much everything else was a con.... The culture is extremely reactive, very little preventative work done and when a problem takes place ITS EXTREMELY URGENT and you're expected to drop everything right then and there. Very poor work/life balance and non-existent boundaries, meaning that your cell phone will be your work phone and you can expect to be called at all hours and on your vacation. Lots of travel expected (to horrible locations in horrible states). All of that in exchange for working at what you expect to be a state of the art company with amazing benefits, neither of which are true. There's hardly any perks to working here; the technology, people, and systems are absolutely archaic. It felt like working in a 3rd world county or the 1960's a lot of the time. Lastly, there seems to be no middle ground in employee satisfaction, meaning that employees are either 1) completely miserable or 2) have a cult mindset where they believe P&G is better than anywhere else in the world despite never having worked elsewhere in their lives.] =",good,terrible,bad

cons: 1. Hire and fire policy. They always say ""company is in difficult time"" and give this as excuse to fire people. At the same time they hire people by paying more !! The job insecurity will never let you perform.
2. Not a great quality work in IT. Very monotonous job which reduces your employability outside. You will find it very hard to find a job outside.
3.The company has many ""ex-Altisource"" employees. This leads to lobbying and others find it hard to grow or even survive

[pros: Great coworkers, good discounts, book check out was cool. Relaxed dress code and allowed self expression.
cons: Zero work/life balance for anyone in management. All managers were expected to clock 45hrs, with GMs not getting any overtime. Physical demands of almost constant floorsets or moves, with barely any payroll to work with, as well as weekly shipments of 3+ pallets of book and gen merch product that is expected to be processed within 24hrs typically by 2-3 people tops. Pay is comically low, and they expect the Spiff pay for MCC & MFM to make up for the awful pay. When sales goals are not being met, even with full effort of the store and staff, I have had upper management say ""You're clearly not trying"" Terry Finley is a joke of a CEO. He posts photos of his multiple vacations on the BAMFAM employees only Facebook page, while store level staff are struggling to make ends meet.

[pros: If you are working in the enterprise storage support space you have excellent work-life balance. The technology is industry leading and EMC is the leader in storage. EMC customer service is 2nd to none and the engineers really do a good job of looking after the customer

If you work for flagship product Symmetrix, you pretty much have superb job security (not to say that other products don't) but relatively speaking, the flagship product will remain forever

Managers (from the EMC side of business) are very approachable and the people are great to get along with. Everyone gels well with another

No repercussions if you dont pull your weight in the team. You can pretty much piggyback on the team and youll get a warning at the most. Australian employee laws will protect you so you can pretty much take a back seat and let the team do the work (you would have to be a nasty piece of work to do this)

Senior management is very transparent and up-front so they set expectations clearly

Work life balance is superb. Managers are very laid back and not overly strict about KPIs.

Managers reward high achievers and recognize them (but not promote). Managers make the effort to encourage you to expand your skillset.
cons: Promotions are based on the length of tenure. You could be working here for 10 years with 0 knowledge and you would probably become a senior or principle. No guidance on career progression and pretty much 0 internal job opportunities if you work in support...If you are talented expect your promotion to be delivered based on your length of service and expect to be underpaid.

Average length of tenure is very very high so you have a lot of ""oldies"" constantly complaining about processes and their dissatisfaction with their job. People are very stuck in their ways and do not embrace change. Becomes quite toxic sometimes...some of the engineers dont know basic networking concepts because they are so stuck in their ways in niche storage products

Engineers cant filter what comes out of their mouth in the workplace. Some of the stuff that is said in the workplace by engineers is downright rude, sometimes racist (insulting customers after hanging up the phone) without any shame or repercussions. Managers dont seem to care and the culture continues...place is almost full of manchilds who cant control the words coming out of there mouth

Near zero internal job movement opportunities....if you are in support expect to stay in support until you quit/retire

After Dell acquired EMC, they have been running the place like a call centre. Dell has pretty much ruined what used to be an awesome organization (EMC). Expect strict/tight budgets and mediocre processes.

If you work in Symmetrix support you are pretty much going to be stuck in the role for your career unless you make the effort to lern something else....] =",excellent,neutral,excellent

[pros: The engineering department is very remote friendly and work life balance is very flexible, but i still would not recommend working here.
cons: This company runs on meetings. I was in an IC role but spent 36 hours a week in zoom meetings. Management of this company has no idea what they are doing. I left before this happened, but they recently laid off almost 1/5th of their staff. The layoffs were done haphazardly. They laid off literally all of their frontend engineers. They are an e-commerce WEB SITE. The methodology picking who to lay off is flabbergasting. The company leadership has no vision. One year, in an employee survey, most of the respondents said that they did not feel like leadership has a real vision for the company. With no irony whatsoever, leadership responded to this by holding employee run workshops to define the vision. They came up with a really vague buzz line. The number of active users on the site is in decline and rather than focus on expanding their user base they've tried to get existing, aging, user base to engage more. These efforts have yielded little results. The business side of leadership has been operating with the same tired playbook they have been using since the early 2010s when i first joined. This is not a tech company by any means. Leadership (including engineering leadership) has not invested in improving the company's technical capabilities in years. Efforts to improve the tech stack or provide the business with new capabilities are often vetoed by people who have no understanding of technology whatsoever. The week I left, a product owner informed me that the chief merchandising officer (yes that's a real title) was pushing back on a messaging bus required to build a feature that they allegedly was going to be a major strategic initiative. The CMO has no idea what a messaging bus is. Her objection was that it would add 3 weeks to the project. No effort, regardless of how impactful is ever given more than a quarter to succeed or fail. There's no long term vision. They consistently chase $10 today instead of $100 tomorrow. Because of how short sighted leadership is, the engineering teams are constantly hamstrung tech debt that hasn't been addressed. Core pieces of architecture were written in 2008, and have not been updated since. The result of this is that things that should take a few weeks take quarters to complete. Relatedly, initiatives are frequently abandoned. Even successful initiatives are abandoned to chase the new shiny thing that has caught someone's eye. In my last two years, every project i worked on was scrapped before it could be completed. The product org has no voice or agency whatsoever. They serve mostly as a go between between business stakeholders and engineering. The communication is always unidirectional. Stake holder tells product what to tell engineering to do. Engineering feedback is never considered by stake holders. Tech leadership does whatever it can to ingratiate itself to business stakeholders and do very poor job advocating for the technology org as a whole. They are doing whatever they can to not ruffle feathers and keep a job. They are incapable of showing the business side why the initiatives that tech needs to do are important. There's a very limited career path in technology. Principal is the highest IC role that exists, and the role is really more honorific than meaningful. When i was there I repeatedly asked for a competency model evaluate myself against, but non existed. The management side of engineering is similarly limited. I worked there for almost 10 years. Not once did I see a manager get promoted to a director. All levels director and above were consistently outside hires. This is unlikely to change because the technology org is the smaller than it has ever over the decade I worked there. The layoffs also knocked back a lot diversity. There weren't many POC or women in engineering, but there are fewer now. More women/POC were let go than currently work in engineering. I don't believe this was intentional, but another example of thoughtless leadership in a company that allegedly values diversity and inclusion.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

It became increasingly clear that the goal of Peace Corps is actually just to station Americans in remote regions to build relationships and soft power - no actual work being done in terms of supporting the communities I thought I was going to serve.

[pros: Welcoming and friendly employees and office culture. Flexible hybrid scheduling and work/life balance. Compensation and benefits are competitive.
cons: The Chief Information Officer completely misrepresented himself during the interview process. Everyone in IT reports directly to him and he micromanages each and every one of them. He can not keep employees who are not sycophantic yes men or otherwise willing to accept his demeaning and unprofessional attitude. I lasted two months and the person I replaced lasted just as long. In addition to being the CIO he is also apparently the office manager for all their global locations, the art designer for the offices, the website creator, app developer (he designed their own in-house ticketing system, poorly I might add) and he makes sure that you are consistently well aware of all of his accomplishments. 

Even though you are in IT, be prepared to have regular study sessions on amino acids and other pesticides and chemicals as he feels that this information is critical to your IT success, warranting multiple meetings while you're onboarding, ramping up, and working on your actual IT projects. Additionally, be prepared to have him try to teach you unsolicited personal life lessons whether you want them or not. 

In the short time I was there, all of the following occurred: 

1. On my first day I was informed of how I should expect to be spoken to by the CIO and to accept it as that is ""just his way"". 

2. Within the first month was also informed that for years they have been trying to get the CIO into management training because of his attitude but no one wants to come forward and speak out against him because of his power and influence and that I should reach out to HR to document his behavior since I'm the new guy. 

3. He calls out, insults, and embarrasses members of his team on group calls rather than pulling them aside in private to discuss his issues with them. What he will do is isolate you after an incident like this to make sure you understand why he had to speak to that person that way. He literally tries to indoctrinate you into believing in his management style, or lack thereof. 

4. The CIO also asked me to basically spy on another employee that I shared an office with because he wanted to know how this employee interacts with members of his team now that this individual no longer reports to him. 

5. HR will dismiss your concerns about him citing ""you are just misunderstanding him"" and to try and work it out on your own. 

You will be enticed by the salary, as I was, but believe me, it is not worth it to work for someone like this. You can do better, I know I did.] =",neutral,terrible,bad

[pros: They are willing to pay for talent

[pros: Learn a lot about tech.
Decent employee discounts on select types of items (especially services).
Now has great starting pay for fairly entry level positions (It's 15$/hr for my store in Texas and I presume that remains largely true for other stores).
I believe everyone should work retail at some point to learn how to treat people.
If you are lucky, you can become part of a team of really cool people.
cons: On a corporate level, HORRID leadership. Constantly making changes that make the employees jobs, and even management's jobs, harder. Best Buy corporate seems to live by the motto, ""If it ain't broke, try to fix it anyway!"" Problem is, their attempts to ""fix it"" largely amount to the equivalent of trying to hammer down a screw. Everything has proceeded to get worse the longer I worked there (over 4 years). They also harp so hard on forcing people to get the credit card, that they are more than happy to ruin customer experience (loosing that customer's business) just on the off-chance that screeching about the card will get someone to apply for one. 

From a per store level, at least at my store, the pressure to get BBY credit cards and total tech support became down-right cut-throat. Enough to cause many people to leave even before covid really hit the US. I'm sure not all stores are like this, but corporate breathes down the neck of the GM's and then it trickles down to the rest of the employees. Nepotism was also rampant toward the end of my stint at Best Buy. Two separate people, who were horrible at their jobs, got hired on the virtue of knowing the GM alone; and proceeded to make working there that much harder; whether it was cleaning up after their mess or having to deal with their weird self-entitlement. I eventually had enough and when covid popped around, I took the opportunity to get out of Best Buy and now have a much better. job.] =",excellent,neutral,terrible

Horrible at notifying employees of a shift change. I was told at 3pm that I would have to work nights the following day.
No work life balance at all.
If you divide up the hours you work with the pay, your hourly rate is awful. You do not get paid for overtime.
Sexism and racism. Very “good ol boy” mentality. Went to my boss multiple times about an HR issue and it was never elevated or even addressed.

[pros: 1.No Layoffs during my long term tenure
2.Embraces Remote Work
3.Used to be a great company backed by Christian values.
4.Education Reimbursement
5. If you had a great Manager/Director, things were great (ignore cons). If you did not it was bad (Read cons). I went from one to the other.
cons: 1. Organizational Tree Bloat

-Seniors > Leads > Supervisors > Managers > Sr Managers > Directors > VPs' > SVP > EVP> SEVP> CEO. This became the most bloated technical company I ever worked for, with an alarming # of middle management having either antiquated or no relevant technical background. This company started off humble & small but hit a growth explosion that was IMO completely mishandled.

-Non-technical managers and directors promoted those who mirror themselves. In other words, those who spend more time talking & self-promoting than having technical qualifications, focusing on the needs of the team and leading.

2. Poor Culture/Self Destructive practices

-With the growth explosion,middle management began vying for promotions and prestige, introducing a a toxic culture.

-Staff were often treated like 'resources'; bad employees were sheltered and hidden from public view so as to not rock the boat, make M.M ""look bad"", or risk losing FTE slots. 

-Hard-working employees were expected to shoulder the load until burnout. (why I and most of my circle left)

-Hard-working employees were asked to work multiple roles instead of hiring appropriate staff to balance workload. “Work life Balance” is a term beaten to death but never practiced. Those who complained were treated poorly thus causing a residual exodus of overloaded staff who were not given relief or support. It was only after people left that management THEN hired multiple people to cover the duties of that one person . I am told this is still happening.

3. No Self-Investment

- This company did NOT actively invest in the professional growth of it's own staff. Lots of preaching about promoting from within but rarely practiced it.

- You were expected to pursue your own education, after which they would gladly give you more work/responsibility, with no benefit to you. (bonus/promotions/opportunity) 

- Current or Ex-Management seemed to get first pick at new opportunities (read: Good old boy network). Saw lots of managers position hop over the years, while others who tried to advance were stuck in their roles until they left.

- There were implied ,but no actual defined career paths. The common advice was to leave the company and apply for roles externally for any decent salary or promotion increases.

4. Political Division/Office Politics

-This company is split into two branches with different leadership structures, akin to what most companies refer to as Front Office and Back Office. 

-Front office for this company has IMO a negligent level of lack of technical ability and education (especially at the management level; the people responsible for hiring front office technical staff). 

-There was an unnatural division & rift between Front Office and Back office (common to a lesser extent I understand). 

-There was a lot of hateful 'us vs them’ rhetoric that spewed from the Front Office. Those who were unlucky enough to have more direct interface with front office were often the punching bag/took the brunt for back office leadership decisions.

5. Little to No Diversity where it matters.

- For as diverse as the workforce is, you could count on one hand the # of non-white leaders in Back office, from the Director and up range (as of 1-2 years ago).] =",bad,bad,none

I have PTSD and ADHD which mean I can't deal with harassment. Lied about me and fired me. And I am afraid the lies he is still telling is hurting me getting another job. Fired lots of people when he took over--none had problems before. All the people he manages know about him but because the way senior management is set up those people don't know. Word is he connected to someone in senior management but I don't know about that. Maybe they just don't know and make no effort to know how he treats employees,] =",neutral,terrible,bad

[pros: The CEO is very well respected and there are some nice benefits like the Eagle Cafe.
cons: First Republic preaches that it is all about relationships. However, this does not extend to its employees. The Bank does not believe in remote work. When the pandemic first started, the bank was initially very progressive by allowing remote work (while still encouraging employees to come in anyway). The economy was still doing well at the time, so employees were leaving in droves for better opportunities, especially when the Bank tried to end its remote work policy. Reluctantly, the Bank implemented a hybrid model of 2-3x per week in the office for all employees to stop the attrition. The economy is now turning for the worse and the Bank seized on this by requiring its employees to be in the office 3-4x per week for most of the Bank. Eventually, the plan will be to require a full 5x a week in the office. This is a big mistake, as once the economy turns, First Republic will lose its best and most talented people who will leave for competitors or other opportunities with far more flexibility. First Republic does not prioritize the mental health or physical well-being of its employees. Instead, they expect them to commute (some commute about 3-4 hours a day), only to take Zoom calls from our cubicles. That's up to 20 hours a week spent commuting, that people do not get to spend with their families, exercise, or get to do things that need to be done at home. Executives do not acknowledge this because they themselves live close to the office and enjoy coming in. Most surprisingly, the Bank fails to recognize that all the commute time had turned into work time for those who were on a hybrid or remote schedule. This will now become lost productivity for the Bank, in addition to employees becoming increasingly unhappy. If you are considering joining this company, please reconsider if you value flexibility.] =",neutral,bad,bad

-The birmingham employees are pleasant to work with
cons: Most of their work is performed in third world countries.

If you are a US citizen, once you have mobilized to your project location, the corporate office does not care if you live or die, you will basically be at the mercy of the project manager. While the salary might look good at first, consider you will be working 60+ hours. At 60+ hours, you are actually just making around $20-25/hr.  
For local employees there are huge wage gaps dependant on how much your PM likes you, and irrelevant to your work performance. Gender discrimination and other types of discrimination are huge too. Local field employees are constantly mistreated and management acts as if they are doing them a favor by providing them with a job.

[pros: - Friednly IT team (at least the one I worked with)
- Nice people in factory
cons: - It's a corpo so expect to be ""a nameless number on big excel s/s
- Forget about creativity (follow directions from ""big boys"" in us of aggression)
- Personal development review - it's impossible to please them (maybe if you show a ""good will"")
- Good will - if you show it they'll turn it in to ""unwritten"" condition on your contract 
- Size issues - whole company is built around propaganda that you'll hear on each big boss meeting ""We are half billion company but we act like ONE billion company"" or another silly one ""Other companies are V4 engines, we are V8 engine!"". You'll understand when you see that circus :)
- Micromanagement - some managers can't manage their own desk...
- Rat race - managers who ""build"" their carrer are the worst. They hold crucial information/knowledge for themselves so they can feel important which in reality is just way to secure their position. That creates tons of issues but that's the way to go.
- SMILE - don't go to work if you have a bad day. You'll be ""kindly"" reminded to put your robotic smile back on because your lack of smile can spread like cancer and affect other people.
- ""Family atmosphere"" - there's no such a thing especially when they announce their favorite sport - redundancies
- IT dept - most overlooked dept in business (Worc). Lads spent millions hours preparing/maintaining bussines for/during covid. Not a single ""thanks"" received. Budget and HW that we had to work with... Lets say IT in that company (Worc) exists only because of dedication (in some cases blind) and talent but not passion. Passion dies in that place. No room to progress, endless boring tasks and constant stress (Yes, as an IT there you'll learn that no one cares about you until something doesnt work or someone has to be blamed).

Senior management don't listen and force their requests to be done, even if it's not right for the customer or supports the business objectives. A lot of 'JFDI'.

[pros: Store Discount? I can barely think of anything to put here.
cons: Where to begin? If you're someone who needs work you'd do better in retail. This is back breaking labor and unless you're desperate for work don't bother. This company is owned by Amazon and it shows, they work you to the bone. An 8 hour shift grants you ONE 30 minute break. That's it. You have to do work that's monotonous, deal with people who are miserable, and work insane hours. I did 3am -12pm shifts and it was the worst job I've ever had. Seriously, look elsewhere. If you have a BA or even an AA I'd recommend retail because that's a better career path than being sweaty, freezing, and in a panic that the store will fire you for not moving like a machine.] =",bad,terrible,bad

cons: Salaried leader pay has not been increased in any shape or form in the past 5 years. ""Always Day 1"" mentality means that you never feel like you are winning, there is always something new that HAS to get done, past results do not factor in at all. During COVID, Amazon provided zero benefits to its salaried leaders, none zilch nada. During COVID, the intense pressures of the job never received any supplementary benefit (unscheduled time off, recognition programs, again no pay increases).

[pros: Health Care Benefits, if you're legitimately sick and cannot come into work you do not have to worry about the effects it will have on your pay. Great opportunities to travel places many do not have the chance to in their lifetime. Depending on the job you have, there are a lot of training programs to increase your knowledge in that field and you may even receive certifications or you are trained well enough to pass the certifications. You may not be paid well vs the work you do but considering all the benefits you receive and ""job security"" some what evens out. Of course, first coming in at a low rank it is not much, especially if you do have a family to have to support, it will be a struggle. However, if you are straight out of high school and you are smart with your money you will do well. If you choose to leave after your contract is out, most will have educational benefits available to continue higher education, prior military tends to place you above a lot of other when applying for jobs. Also, (depending on your MOS) the certifications you may have received or able to receive without a company not having to train you for is a massive jump among others as well as the experience you have in that field. You don't have to stay in the field you originally choose, if your ASVAB scores were low and didn't allow you many MOS options, you can retake that and they even offer courses to help you do that. If you already meet requirements for a different MOS you would like try for you can put in a request and if approved you will go to that AIT as an MOS-T.
cons: The amount of work you will do, will not feel like it is represented in the pay you receive. If you have a family, you may have to be away from them for longer than you would want. This is not a 9-5 job. You will more than likely run into some crappy leadership, best I can say is, learn from it, remember it and be the change you want to see.

cons: I can't even begin to describe what this job is like. This whole company feels like a major scam as we bombard our clients with phone calls nonstop. Extremely unethical selling techniques that I have not seen in any sales job I've worked.  You are making 150-300 calls a day and every time a client picks up they hate you and the company.

cons: Marketing uses outside companies based on personal relationships, not professionalism. The SEO company is terrible and the online reviews show it but the CEO's are buddies.

Biggest complaint however is the staff came together and gave our opinion on something that was flat out wrong. They listened and said they appreciated feedback.

[pros: PTO/Sick Time
Maternity/Paternity leave 
Health insurance
cons: E verything else! From the CEO down to VPs Directors and Managers are all egomaniacs hoping to look good in front of their boss at any cost. The way they run POLS is a complete and utter mess with zero regard for personal responsibility. Managers don’t care about employees at any capacity, professional or personal. Employees speak up about many issue which they sweep under the rug or have a bandaid approach to like anonymous feedback. They don’t do anything to change however.

The WFH perks only applied to management for them to abuse whenever they wanted while their employees had strict schedules with the threat of getting that “perk” taken away as they felt fit. Like when university partners would tour the offices so we weren’t allowed to WFH that day, but also weren’t allowed to get up to use the restroom or wear jeans or go to lunch. If you wore jeans or got up to grab water you’d get reprimanded. All to put up appearances.

You won’t get promoted unless they’re understaffed (which they often are because of high turnover) and you’re a last resort. The only way to get a raise or a better role is by doing a project (yes, like in school) proving you read some books and ran some tests and a presentation. Just busy work, a waste of time, a hurdle to stop employees from being too ambitious. You weren’t even eligible to participate in this project until you’d been employed for a year.

They purposely only assign you certain work in digital media so you don’t develop a well rounded skill set and it’s harder for you to leave. They also hire lots of recent college grads because that’s the only demographic that’d accept low pay in exchange for experience in the field and wouldn’t speak up about the toxic environment. 

The cherry on top is the massive layoffs that have happened since just before and during the pandemic. Another soulless mega company too big to fail where you’ll feel exploited, exhausted, and drained every day.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: There are some very talented engineers.

Many of the more senior engineers have been with the company for an impressive number of years.

Some projects are interesting, and may allow engineers to try new things.
cons: You're going to have Zoom meetings at inconvenient times, no matter where you are. Development teams will have members in the U.S. Pacific and Central time zones and in India. This is the worst on for those in India (evening meetings) and in California and Oregon (early morning meetings, as early as 6 a.m.).

Since everyone is working remotely, there's not much chance as an incoming employee to get to know your teammates, or to have them get to know you. Under these circumstances, you might find that longer-tenured employees are supportive on the surface, but not really supportive.

Agile development: it's followed in name, mostly in the guise of Scrum; but it's just skin deep. The company on the whole is more Waterfall-oriented. There aren't any professional Scrum Masters, only engineers with an interest and (maybe) training. Also, managers like to participate on all of the Scrum ceremonies; in no sense are such teams self-organizing or self-managed.

An incoming engineer at a senior level is expected to absorb a great deal of organizational and domain-specific knowledge in a hurry and quickly become a major contributor to multiple projects. That may work out, or not. If it doesn't, don't expect to hear anything about it from your management until it's too late to correct course.

Engineers don't get promoted readily. There are very high achieving engineers with a massive number of years in the company who only have a middling rank.

Diversity in U.S. hiring is a goal, but not as much of a practice as in many other technology companies.

If your goal is to make the world appreciably better, you might not be satisfied here.] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: Google will throw perks at you as a way to make you stay; the food is great (outside of MTV), the offices are beautiful and there's a lot of smart people to work with.
cons: I don't even know where to start.

Internal mobility sucks: the ladder transfer process is extremely bureaucratic; depending on your current role, hiring managers won't even reply to your email; you need to know the right people to get the job, otherwise you'll keep hitting the wall. 
That said, if you ever hear ""gTech"", run like the devil runs from the cross. One of the luring tactics they'll use to get you to enter gTech is to say moving internally is a real possibility -- except that gTech hires engineers to sales support roles, and other orgs at Google don't give a gTech engineer any credit (because we have nothing to show for our work, which is not technical, not interesting, not relevant). I was naive enough to believe the job description, which sounded actually interesting, just to start in a role that led me to depression and undermined my coding skills, because my main task (when I wasn't in useless meetings) was archiving emails.
Don't do that to yourself. If you want to be a Software Engineer at Google, postpone your application and study for an actual SWE role. Don't join gTech thinking it opens doors, because it actually closed them.

Now, for those who care about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion: Google doesn't. Of course, the image we get is that everything is a shining rainbow of happiness, inclusivity and cooperation, but if you speak up about things that actually matter, they will make you shut up. The louder you are, the bigger the consequences. Google is mostly made of privileged demographics that couldn't care less about any event or initiative about DEI internally. What ends up happening is that the underrepresented people end up getting yet another expectation of DEI champion, and that will only slow down their progress, productivity and, ultimately, compensation and career progression.

Overall: the food is great, but it's not worth the trouble 👍] =",terrible,bad,good

For the company we are just resources, they accepted to give us full-remote because they were not able to recruit, people have changed their life and after less than a year they decided to go back to the office without exception.

[pros: The discounts are good on most products and great on products made by Best Buy. You can do your job in your own way to an extent as long as you're reaching the end goal that aligns with what your manager expects from you. You have the opportunity to build close relationships with the customers, which makes it feel less like a job and more like helping a friend. Learning about technology can be interesting if it fits your niche making it feel less cumbersome when you need to learn about products. Opportunity to move up in the company especially if you're a woman seeking management opportunity.
cons: Forced to act like a robot depending on management. I worked at a successful store so we were expected to basically shove store card offers, additional accessories, warranties, etc down their throat no matter the circumstance. As an associate, you learn when it is necessary to do so especially after building rapport with them but that doesn't matter to management. If they don't hear you trying to beg them into buying or applying for something multiple times to the same person, it's not enough. This can take away sense of humanity you have from the person and make everyone look at you like the robot you don't want to be. The more you learn, the more you realize how ignorant people can be. Sometimes you have to let a customer's ignorance hurt them instead of fighting it. Uniforms are pretty formal. No jeans or khakis, tucked in shirt, name tag, and all black shoes are required. Seemed like all the management that actually cared about the employees got fired or left.] =",excellent,neutral,bad

[pros: Our company (QSR side) offers ALL the overtime one could imagine.
cons: Our company practically forces a QSR general manager AND its employees to work horrible hours. 70+ for GM's & 50+ for employee's (both full and part time). Our company boasts paid leave, vacation, tuition reimbursement & other well meaning perks. The sad truth however, is that unless you're sleeping through school you will NOT have the time to enjoy ANY of these ""job perks"". The people here, myself included, are OVER WORKED & UNDER PAID. Trying to get support from your supervisor or their supervisor is like spitting in the wind! SMH, the potential for a business such as this is endless but we don't have ""Aces in their places"". ( And we aren't effectively trying to get there either) If you accept a position w/ CK -Circle K, Use it as a platform to get where you want/need to be. This should NOT be considered a career company. I repeat, Circle K IS NOT to be considered as a career company. Sorry.] =",neutral,bad,bad

[pros: The people were fine enough to work with. The guarantee of full time employment is a plus.
cons: The company falsely advertises its pay and job duties. Firstly, they will tell you the hourly rate is $15 hourly, but what they *won't* tell you is that the $15 hourly is incentive pay; meaning if you are unable to work full time, you will be paid the *base rate* of $10 hourly. The way they market their openings, they imply that $15 hourly is base rate. Secondly, when hired on, I was originally supposed to review documents for project permits. Once on boarding was complete and my training finished, they told me I was to answer customer service phone calls and that my availability would be ""taken into account"" but then they would schedule me for time I had specifically asked to have open for doctor's appointments and court hearings for an ongoing legal issue. This place had insane amounts of turnover due to burnout or better opportunities. You're better off passing this one up.] =",neutral,bad,bad

[pros: None that I can think of
cons: Very toxic work environment even though I was a remote employee. Higher ups were not helpful and just set the front line employees up for failure. The training
Process could use a lot of help as it trains you for nothing compared to what is expected. Some “favorites “ got overlooked on mistakes while others got docked points wise on performance. Management was very sarcastic in response and blew employees off when asking for help. One would say one thing and another would say something completely different, very inconsistent! Lack of leadership even though there were plenty playing the role of one (how I don’t know!) The level of passiveness to the customers was insane also! No care or concern and it became obvious VERY QUICKLY that the customers were not top priority! Lost policies, inability to contact departments regarding policies, front line workers not adequately trained leading to the inability to even get to the correct department, AND NOBODY CARES!

cons: Job security is very low, company business model is market negative ...so if people dont pay mortagages company does well. but if moratoriums are there , company does horrible.

[pros: What a great product! If you genuinely care about finding creative ways to recognize people, and making work more personal this is the product for you. They have hired some amazing people on the ground, who work hard and care. The product brings in genuinely caring humans. Looks like they just got more funding, which is great, this is a needed product and does good in the world unlike so many others. Work life balance is very reasonable.
cons: The CEO. Plain and simple. He is rude when he should be supportive and empowering. There is nothing worse than taking motivated and creative people, and watching them progressively deteriorate. Furthermore the consensus from conversations with former colleagues is he thinks he is always right, which routinely results in changing directions , wasted money and a sense of defeat. It is very difficult to feel like you are making a difference when you are so powerless. The general perspective when I was there is that senior leadership hired poorly in other senior leadership roles as well, leading to a demoralized workforce, and nobody willing to push back on Raph.

[pros: Long before covid Atos was a remote company for the most part. The culture is very oriented towards working remote and teleconference has been the norm a long time. The company is generally pretty flexible and a good place for a do-it-yourselfer, you will get very little if any career coaching or help in building your career. The good is you can do whatever you want as long as you can bill someone.
cons: Continued revolving door of CEO for north america. European influence in leadership of company continually seems to not be able to understand a cultural difference in how business works in north american versus europe. For example, in USA we don't really allow a key employ to take ""holiday"" for 6 weeks and let a customer just deal with it, ....they don't understand that in europe.

[pros: The associates are dedicated, hard-working and very supportive. Fair compensation across the company and good healthcare benefits.
cons: 1.	Poor work-life-balance. With people working from home, there is a lack of understanding and respect of people’s hours and other priorities. People email and communicate late at night and there is a sense that to get work done, people need to stay up late or work through the night. Meetings are being scheduled before 8am or after 6pm, without regard to other people’s schedule. The company is also too-meeting heavy. Many use meetings to get things done, rather than to quickly report on tasks. 

2.	Lack of long-term thinking. There is a constant churning of senior leadership. With that comes continual changes in strategy, systems and how things get done on a day-to-day basis. The company is very short-term focus and the continual changes causes negative impact to the long-term. 

3.	Lack of career growth. All senior leadership are brought from the outside, and those people hire people that they are familiar with for higher-level positions. Because of this, middle-management associates aren’t considered for promotions. There is no promote from within at Nice-Pak. In fact, there hasn’t been any promotions in marketing within 3+ years. 

4.	Poor communication from functional senior leadership. With the pandemic and employees working remote, communication is very important. I noticed that there is increased silos across functions, and even across different business units. Senior leadership aren’t taking the time to communicate across functions/groups and connect with people, outside of projects. 

5.	Lack of consistent performance review. In my years at Nice-Pak, each year the performance review process was different. There is a lack of consistency in evaluating employees. While the competencies have been consistent, the way that employees are evaluated against them aren’t clear. 

6.	Lack of appreciation for employees. There is rarely acknowledgement from executive leadership of the hard work that middle-lower level employees do. When notes are sent out, it does not seem genuine, as there is a lack of follow-up or sense that real effort was made to appreciate people.] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: Started off being a great place to work prior to the OFD takeover.
Loved the family oriented culture and flexible work schedules under Yabuki.
cons: I have watched with sadness this fin tech giant being torn apart piece by piece since what felt like hostile takeover by First Data and its CEO.

Fiserv used to be an employee oriented company with a large WFH workforce. It was successful through the pandemic until recently when the CEO and his old-fashioned ways caused a mass exodus by a lot of talented employees due to being forced to work form an office, relocate or get laid off. 

I was hired as a full-time remote employee along with the rest of my team but after months of threats by senior manager, the hammer finally came down hard forcing everyone to offices. 
In most cases there are no offices in our areas and so we are forced to either relocate cross country or quit. Supposedly a relocation package will be offered but nobody knows what that is.

The worst part is the complete disregard of seasoned, knowledgable and loyal employees and zero effort to retain them. I was disheartened when senior officers started saying that this change was driven by employees! It was NOT! 
 This is a lie! 
There is spyware on everything and badge swipes and keystrokes are monitored because there is no trust that most people have enough integrity to get their jobs done, such a shame.
So many sad people are now scrambling to figure out how to support their families because they are unable to comply with the recent, archaic work ethics.

Please ignore the positive reviews as most are by overseas hires, and people told to post positive reviews. Most of these are not actual employees who have been there for a long time. 
This is not a company that cares for employees and it's currently sinking faster than the Titanic.] =",bad,terrible,none

[pros: For the most part working as a Cashier at Goodwill is pretty easy. We get a 30minute lunch break. My co-workers are very friendly welcoming, and helpful. I love that we have a digital time clock system and get direct deposit.
cons: The customers can be a real pain, because they are always trying to find way to get over on you and get items for basically nothing even though everything in the store is already highly discounted compared to what they would have originally sold for. Also some of the policies can make working a little difficult, such as the fact that Cashiers do not have the authorization to do returns, exchanges, employee checkouts, or line voids on their own. So every time one of these situations come up I have to call for a manager and them wait for them to finally come up to the front to put in their code and do it themselves. Doing this every time always causes a hold up and I just end up with a long line of frustrated, impatient customers.
Another thing I recently found out is that we do not get paid overtime, mainly because we aren't allowed to get overtime, and can actually get written up if we ever do get overtime. Then we have to work holidays, but we do not get any kind of holiday pay other than our regular wage.
Employees aren't even allowed to shop at the store they work at, so you would have to go all the way to another store just to shop and use your employee discount. Its almost impossible to get a steady schedule.] =",excellent,good,excellent

[pros: - Somewhat relaxing if you know what your manager is after, otherwise you may feel like get bullied!
- Being mutual feels good, there are some super nice people working there
- There's a push toward being customer-centric and fair to them
- I guess it's an excellent place for insurance people like actuaries/adjusters, but not really for any strong technical person like a software developer
- Maybe THE place for programmers with weak technical skills, but great people skills. If you're such a person, you'd be a lord there!
- Colleagues are so nice, friendly, supportive, and collaborative
cons: - Individual career track is capped and you're forced to become a manager to grow! 
- Terrible pay and performance assessment procedure. It's subjective and unfair
- Typical raise rate does not even beat the inflation!
- Chaotic plans and roadmaps, like start-ups!
- Many fake slogans at the company level, e.g. on a daily basis you try to sell higher, but at presentations to people outside department, you're FORCED to say we sell a fair price
- Too much IT (IS) restrictions on your laptops! 
- Bullying and micromanagement is pretty much standard across almost all managers and executives. So strange! It should be a chain of command issue
- Not tech savvy at all. It'd just a waste of your time. You should expect to report to an inexperienced manager who knows pretty much nothing about the technical aspects of your job. Sadly they are in charge of assessing your performance!] =",neutral,neutral,good

[pros: Money, work life balance, great ""part-time"" job, benefits.
cons: Cons
Thanks for taking the time to read my review. I have been with Oracle for over a decade. I write this to give potential candidates a real look into the company. Someone who has been with the company 12-24 months may not have a very wide view since you are required to stay in a position for a year and people rarely leave their area. I have worked in several different areas in my time at the company. I came on as part of an acquisition. You will see folks who give good ratings and approve of the CEO, but it’s really good to check to see how long they’ve been there as Oracle will not show all their cards up front. That typically doesn’t happen until you’re in there a few years. Good Luck! 

Training & Development – In my almost 20 years here, I have never witnessed any dedicated employee development. Part of management's job is to develop their employees, but that is completely non-existent. In the Global Business Units (GBU's) it's even worse. Oracle's latest “employee development” program literally has employees filling out word docs about their goals and such. Basically what people did in 1999. As for actual training, for the courses someone might need to improve in their jobs or become more skills, Oracle will charge you thousands of dollars to take them. In my years here, I had one training course that my unit paid for. With the advent of the cloud, you are able to get access to subscription learning. These are setup as videos for the most part, so you're just watching powerpoint slides go by and once you're done, there's no real reinforcement. In my time here I have not watched one person be developed from a hire to employee to management. Usually in a decade you would have one or two examples of progression. 

Salaries & Raises – I know of a person who was recently asked to transfer teams, but they originally thought it was a promotion and then told it was not. The person transferred teams and then was asked to apply for the position. The departments are basically doing anything underhanded they can to save money and they do not care if people leave. People are leaving my unit in droves. There is a ton of managers who are just flat out leading people on. And as many have mentioned here, the lowest in the industry. If you are considering this company as a place of employment, negotiate as high as you can. In our unit of thousands of people, there have been people who have not even gotten a cost of living raise in 5-10 years. Managers, as well as directors, are pretty spineless and won’t stick up for anyone. I have watched people get lied to about money, I have watched colleagues be sold one job and think they were getting their “level” raise only for the manager to remove the job and create another job that was a lateral move. You are around some really scummy low down people. This is not like the big and successful tech companies. This is basically the lowest end of tech. With that being said, you need to do something remarkable to get any type of raise. You need to really beat everyone on your team and basically be perfect for 12 months. And even then, quite the stretch. And they’ll tell you, “that’s all we could get from management. Be happy you got anything at all.” I have heard directly from someone who was protected that when they contacted HR about the “promotion” that actually had them making less money, the HR person said, “you should just be happy you got a promotion.” Management that are friends with other managers will also have an impact on those things. I have gotten raises in my time here, but with salaries being so low, it's not a lot. As mentioned before, if you get in via an acquisition, you could get a nice bump from what you were making, but that's up for negotiation between Oracle and the old company. 

Work-Life Balance – The single reason I have heard anyone stays here is because they can work from home and get their work done in 4-5 hours a day. That's really the biggest benefit of the company and don't think anyone would argue. 

Management – Lead with talent and qualifications and not who your buddy was at a partner/acquisition/high school/pre school. There are many thick and useless layers of management. Many of them with very little technology and or real IT experience. When Oracle acquires smaller companies, if they are under the GBU framework, the company can basically say, a janitor is now a Senior Director and no questions are asked. I have watched scores of people come in that way and just leapfrog over people who have been in the unit for decades. It's even more embarrassing when the people who have been there basically know 10 times more about everything and the new member of management just sits around being social and not really contributing. I've also never seen the same members of management sit in the same exact positions for decades. These managers stay in office longer than presidents. Their attitudes are smug and many are downright hated by their team members. The thing is, you work in a tech company and you should know the buzz words or at least know what they mean. I have been in meetings where a director actually said to someone two levels below them that, “that's not their job to know how to do this or that...that's on you to know...” At Oracle, as opposed to many other companies I have worked at, to be in management, you do not need to have been good at any one particular job or the jobs of your team. It is truly amazing. My thought is they stay because no companies really want them. 

The Cloud – applications on the cloud were deployed with very little strategy or education to the employees. They will never catch the other tech companies that are staffed with better talent and management. Management wants to tout the cloud as being a success, but it's basically because customers are basically strong-armed into going to it and they are flat out lied to when speaking about the overall performance of the cloud. There is also a mentality among management and long time employees that Oracle is better than Amazon. Anyone who knows the tech sector right now, knows that's laughable. At Oracle, they can't even speak about their competition because they're getting beaten so bad. What's worse is that there are smaller companies that are now coming up that have better products, better platforms, cheaper price and less problems.] =",terrible,bad,excellent

[pros: FW offers a lot of great benefits personally and professionally. The casual office environment helps contribute to a comfortable work space which can go a long way given the work pressure associated with agency life. Prior to the pandemic, there were also plenty of events, from happy hours and catered lunches in-office to fun team activities and excursions. You'll also learn a lot, as job roles are very loosely defined, enabling you to pick up skills in multiple areas. I also appreciate that they are one of the few agencies that will take a chance on aspiring medical writers with no prior experience.
cons: Being understaffed means being overworked. Since going remote, it was pretty typical to work morning, day, night and weekend to get ahead of the deadline pressure, and that lack of work-life balance leads to burn-out and low team morale. There is a lot of talk about infinite potential for growth and a mentality that the work you put in is what you'll get out, but it became clear that compensation wasn't really connected to personal production or responsibility. Even if your team is killing it due to the OT you're putting in, you'll get an annual raise that won't reflect your hours or effort.] =",excellent,good,terrible

[pros: Was fun for me. I loved seeing that store grow.
cons: New ownership took over this store in 2022. The people over it was heartless and only cared for numbers over the people they had working for them. I had a medical emergency with my child, let area manager know what was going on. I got my shift covered and thought I was doing everything by the book. 4 days later the Area Managers came in and demoted me from the management position giving me no reason at all for my demotion. They said they had made their decision and it was final. I had not been written up or been told at any point that I was doing anything wrong. If I had, I would have done my best to fix the problem, because I seriously wanted to see this store succeed. They do not care about their employees or emergencies they may have. Not once did they ask how my son was doing after his emergency and after me almost losing my son. You can't trust them because the Area Managers lie and make others take the fall for their own shortcommings. They will make others take the fall. They will work you to the point of burn out. I cared deeply for this company, overall, but not this owner and his Area Managers. They do not go by Gordon's mission statements and Core Values, which I think all the Area Managers should abide by too. Not just their store Manager and employees.] =",excellent,bad,bad

[pros: Nice peers to work with
cons: - very unorganized, from the start of training.
- system access may take awhile
- management somewhat helpful, at times you may have to figure things out for yourself or ask your peers
- there seems to be a lack of information regarding COVID. you have some reps that are working from home due to COVID and others in office in not so 'great' conditions, you have people coughing, and sneezing, yes you wear face mask when walking around but there's no real way to have safe distance when you're working beside/behind one another and share a breakroom, then advised you can't eat at your desk as an option either. It really sucks to wok where people are clearly sick at times, not knowing if you're putting yourself at risk of COVID and returning to your family and the most management/director would offer is to wear your mask but you have the reps at home able to be safe and we aren't. Then you ask about the option to wfh that's out of the question for you despite your concerns. What I would like to know where is the checklist that qualifies you to work from home, because others are still being sent home so what gave those reps the opportunity and my quality is where it needs to be so what then. LabCorp also sent out an 'Flexible Workplace Policy' that allows employees to wfh if their job description allows (which clearly does) or even allowing its employees time home and/or in office, so I guess that policy only applies to certain reps. I just feel the safety options should be fair all across LabCorp not just who management pick and choose. These cases with COVID are increasing everyday and reps are scared, they shouldn't have to choose between their safety or finding new employment. It sucks] =",neutral,bad,bad

They are more focused on building more properties and hiring from outside than improving the product they currently have and training the people that have already invested time. We get a monthly budget to purchase necessary room and property items for our properties and that budget NEVER comes close to getting us everything we need. Also expect to do more sales than management in this role.

Customer Service is about cheap flights. With such an erratic flight schedule, delayed/canceled flights can leave their customers out in the cold.
Constant stream of complaints and lack of satisfaction amongst their Flight attendants.] =",good,bad,bad

The store manager in charge of my training was too busy trying to defend his own case of his absence and lack of guidance during my training with so many words that I could not even express my concerns with him.

HR department is very spiteful I attempted to refer my spouse as a part timer and unfortunately we were bot going to be able to make ends meet with a part time salary and respectfully declined the offer. Months later when we were at a better place she applied for the same position and was told she did not qualify. It was a entry level part time teller positions with no experience needed, and she’s been in finance for 3 years? They would rather keep horrible employees around who do no work and are very rude to customers and employees properly discipline them or get them out. Good employees are overlooked for promotions all the time for “tenured” employees. I was recently wrongly terminated for a verbal altercation with one of those lazy horrible employees who has in the past been reported to HR . I applied for unemployment and was denied. This is after I came in early left late worked OT, came in during COVID, when said bad employee would have a “family emergency”, came during multiple power outages, AC problems, sewage and plumbing problems.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: This is a well paying company but you have to sell your soul and integrity to work here even for a day. I left the company in exactly 1 month after joining because I couldn't stand to be part of such a HUGE SCAM.
cons: Where do I even start. Every aspect of this company is a scam. To begin with the teachers teaching kids have no experience in coding. They are completely cheating their customers by saying the top IT professionals are teaching. 

The entire sales pitch is a big fat lie. The saddest part is they expect you to intimidate parents of small kids and manipulate them into enrolling their kids. It's an extremely aggressive sales team that is expects you to keep harassing the customer till they buy the product.  Once a customer registers they are called ATLEAST 10-12 times till make a purchase.

Even though they pay employees well they have 0 respect for their workforce. They literally treat them like robots. I've seen people get fired for the smallest of small mistakes. This company has absolutely NO work life balance. You are expected to work everyday for 14-15 hours a day. YES, NO WEEKLY OFFS. They have team meeting at 8 am - 12 pm - 5 pm and 10 pm that goes on till 12. Absolutely horrible work culture where people are continuously motivating you to lie and cheat customers to earn your incentives.  The policy here is promise anything to make a sale. 

Targets are high but so are incentives. You don't meet them for 2 weeks they put you on Pip and in another 2 weeks if you don't meet the target you are ruthlessly fired.

 Also, they are bluntly lying about their affiliations and programs. They are in no way connected to IIM BANGALORE or GOOGLE. Or any of the other institutes they print out on their certificates. Their certificate is absolutely useless. 

I don't know how someone like Karan Bajaj is so shamelessly LYING to the world.  STOP THIS SCAM.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

There was no clear explanation of the structure of command. I never had any idea who my direct supervisor was.
The atmosphere of the facility felt like a prison. Nobody seemed happy to be there.
There was never any chance for interaction with other people during the course of my shifts, and music was not permitted, so you're just stuck alone in a trailer with your thoughts and infinite boxes all night. Then, you go home and sleep through the day, so you rarely get to interact with anyone outside work either.

[pros: Good resume builder, skill building development, and diversity
cons: Boomer mentality of C suite worship. Out of touch work environment where the older workers at the top really don't understand the current workforce and don't care to learn. Passive aggressive internal branding to employees. 

In office worship culture with a toxic ""we are a family"" vibe. Nah, you are not my family. I have a family at home I barely get to see anymore because I spend 20 hours a week on the daily grind commuting to the office. I would much rather have my personal time back to spend with my actual family and to build relationships with my actual friends. I do not need forced socialization at work. I sit alone at a desk all day on zoom calls with maybe 10 other people on my floor. Some of the people on my calls are in the office but on different floors so we may as well all be at home aside from the occasional on site meetings and events. 

Classic boomer mentality completely ignoring the fact that we have performed way better in the 2.5 years at home. Completely ignoring the high turnover and rock bottom employee morale. It is pretty cringe how they force us in the office for culture but that culture is only subordination, backstabbing to get ahead and look good for leadership, and petty politics. Nobody here is your friend.

[pros: Wonderful people and talent in the business
cons: As long as the current Chief People Officer (CPO) remains in her position, my advise is to stay away from the company if you are in HR. Her c-suit peers despise her, other senior leaders in the company avoid her at all cost, and her own functional team members either fear her or are plotting their escape from her reign. Average tenure in HR - which she ironically calls People Success - is 1.5 years and even less on the HRBP side. HR business partners’ attrition is the worst as she does not appreciate nor understand the true purpose of an HRBP because in her 17 years with the company she only had roles in Compensation before being crowned CPO. 
Improvement ideas to up level HR business support are being ignored, impactful initiatives to support business leaders are being squashed, and true HRBPs who have gained the trust of the business executives they support are labeled as having “gone native” and are marked in the broader HR leadership team.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: I got to meet a lot of really good people and still friends with them today. The pay is on time and the food is really cheap.
cons: Experienced some of my worst years in that place. The sexual harassment and bullying were overlooked. What was even crazy was that team leaders would sometimes join in on the bullying. The racist culture is so engrained in the workplace that it was normal to make comments about someone’s race or differences and no one made any comments. I constantly went home upset because if I wasn’t being sexually harassed, or being racially insulted by someone I would be yelled at my a colleague or team leader. One incident that stands out for me was when I was yelled at and insulted by one of colleagues for 5 minutes straight for something I didn’t do. This happened in front of a team leader, cast mates and guests. Instead of being dealt with the TL came to me and said “it’s okay, that person is always angry, just do your job and you’ll be okay”. If that wasn’t bad enough, I had to deal with the constant sniggering and side comments that came after the incident. I also witnessed a colleague of mine constantly being bullied, probably worse than I was and when they broke down and had a meltdown, people laughed and said that person was being dramatic. That being said, I was good at my job. However, there are cliques and there are favourites so you’re left to do the worst jobs if you’re not with the “in” crowd. So I was constantly picked on. My best decision was to leave that place however, I still have trauma from some of the things I experienced there that I don’t think will ever fully go away.] =",good,terrible,terrible

Chat coaches are a joke and help is never really available. To top it off you'll be making a commission of anywhere between $5-$12 a sale IF you meet certain requirements if not you'll get nothing.

[pros: If you tough it out, then you'd have Walmart on the resume.
Cheap health club.
5% off certain things in Walmart.
cons: Boys club.
If you do exactly what you are told, show up to meetings and ask for permission every step of the way you can be a lifer in Walmart tax.
It is a check-the-box culture that doesn't appreciate initiative and out of the box thinking. Be prepared for long hours, weekends during the tax season and periodically during the year. People who talk a lot and do little move up. Doers get more work and no appreciation.

Salary is low. Bonus is average. PTO is a joke. Pay raise is joke.
They promise a lot, and then you face the reality of overpromise.

Very basic set of benefits. Low maximum on life insurance, ad&d, spousal benefits. Health insurance monthly payment is average however the cost of care is high - be prepared to pay cash.

[pros: • My coworkers are truly wonderful, they make working here bearable.
• A few managers are absolute gems, and they’re on top their job, and are actually willing to learn from experienced staff.
• Pretty good discount.
cons: • Some managers are completely clueless and have no idea what they’re doing, and are unwilling to learn, which is terrible when they're supposed to lead their departments. So it usually falls to regular staff to handle everything.
• Far too much work is given to staff, without giving us the time we need to actually get it done, and when things don’t get finished on time it’s always the staff’s fault for not going above and beyond.
• If there’s any issues at the end of your shift, you’re expected to stay on until it’s sorted, but it’s up to you to make sure you get paid accordingly.
• You are expected to keep up to date with all updates, notices and training, even on your days off, and with all the work that is heaped onto staff, it means you are constantly thinking about what work you need to do during your next shift in your downtime, so you have very bad work/life balance.
• Management often change people’s shifts on very short notice, and don’t even have the courtesy to tell you.
PFS staff are not given Hazard Pay, despite all the risk we contend with, and it being standard at other companies.
• It feels very much like the company doesn’t care about it’s staff, and they regularly post updates on how well the company is profiting, and all the staff get as a hollow thank you. If a company is making record profits, the people who do the hardest work should be getting a bonus, not just the board members and executives.] =",bad,neutral,bad

[pros: WFH, because travelling at early morning from office to your home after work has been avoided because my work timing was 10.00 AM to 3.00AM or 2.30 AM
cons: Treat employees like human not like slaves
Give respect to the employees personal time, understand that one cannot sit in front of laptop 24/7 ,even in every weekend.

Don’t try to restructure a team which is performing consistently and been productive, just to get the report to the higher management that the employee Worklife balance had been taken care.

Working in multiple projects is fine, but assign tasks based on complexity not based on count that each employee has to be given with.

Don’t ask a devops engineer why a build can’t be completed 15 to 20 mins, for this to be understood, one should know how much the source-code size is.

No hike or hardly you will get 2% and no variable pay, even they cut the employees salary for 3 months, during the first lockdown lastyear stating that sacrifice your half salary for the company’s growth.

[pros: Phenom has a self-starting culture. They encourage employees to think outside the box, collaborate, and problem solve. The company is demanding so they do (usually) make sure to hire extremely talented and capable people. You’ll be surrounded by top-tier talent. 

Unlimited PTO and generally very flexible schedules. The workload is obscene, but my managers very much had the “I don’t care how/when it’s done” attitude. By the time I left Phenom I pretty much came and went as I pleased and made my own schedule. 

For most of my time at Phenom, it felt like the sky was the limit. You were told that if you worked hard and stuck around, you’d get to experience history. Always talks about being a part of the eventual IPO. 

Lots of opportunities for cross-functional work and to pitch new ideas. I originally loved doing these things because I was trying to prove my commitment and showed I wanted to grow at Phenom.
cons: Now I will counter all of the points I made under pros.

1. Self-starter culture and quality of talent - You need to be a self-starter because it’s chaos. There isn’t a lot of direction. The product changes rapidly, is buggy, and communications aren’t always clear, so you’re constantly chasing answers. You have to troubleshoot in real time with angry customers. It’s always catch up and never proactive. You’re told that this is just Phenom’s way and you need to be special to work there. So when you start to feel burned out, you feel guilty and ungrateful. Also, you may work with great people, but you might as well set a timer the day they start. In my years at Phenom, most lasted barely a year themselves. So you also have to deal with constant turnover which also destroys communication and productivity. 

2. I recently made the joke that Phenom offers unlimited PTO so you always have time to take off and cry. Yes, my schedule was flexible. But I worked 12 hour days most days. There was so much work to do, but it wasn’t meaningful work all the time. Again, it was a lot of catch up and patch jobs. Most of my days were spent putting out fires. So my schedule was flexible and some days I logged off at one pm because my brain couldn’t take it anymore, but I was back online by 6pm and worked until 10pm. Weekend work was a normal part of life. When I mentioned that the hours were burning me out, I was told Phenom doesn’t have a “clock in/out” culture. You interpret that how you will. 

3. Cross functional work needs to happen because everyone is stretched thin and thrown into their jobs so fast with no training that they constantly need to pull people from other departments in to help. It becomes less about proving yourself and trying to expand your skill set and more about just staying afloat. 

4. All the talk of IPO and I’ve never worked for a company that’s less prepared for it. Internal processes are non-existent, leadership is a revolving door, weird restructuring happens in an attempt to fix gaps. Phenom would crack under the pressure of shareholders in its current state.] =",bad,bad,none

[pros: The idealistic corporate ethos is inspiring and would be a great motivating factor if it trickled down to the largest subset in the field -- Store Associates.
cons: Most Store Leadership teams I've been exposed to (at multiple locatioms) operates in fear of corporate rather than in tandem. This results in Associates on the floor not feeling supported, DHs not being fully empowered to drive their business and ASMs often perpetating bad behavior to check off boxes, even when it does not make the most sense.] =",neutral,neutral,bad

[pros: Started out well. Turned out you could trust no-one and that fake-positivity definitely is real and messes things up for every human being. Trust degenerates, critique dies out, everything collapses to the point of no-trust, confinement, bewilderment and misunderstandings out of the general.
cons: Your laid-off politics is horrible, based on partly observance and (totally) biased statement in combination with what a few customers have found is not to their liking. That's not solidarity, it's not a good way to observe and/or handle your employees and a complete shame to the company. They evaluate according to attitude without saying (this includes what you are looking at, if your eyes are closed, how you put yourself in the chair, the clothes your wear, the chit-chat you use so forth and so on. Although you are encouraged to do this, it falls down on biased view-points and double-standards in the extreme.

[pros: 3 weeks vacation to start off, but only allowed to take a week at a time. You cannot split them up
cons: The biggest con to being a supervisor at a warehouse is the Union. I have never seen so many grow men and women cry and complain. Productivity is terrible too because the warehouse employees won’t go above and beyond because the union tells them they don’t have to. There is zero respect from the warehouse workers to management. There is a bonus but a part of it depends on how the warehouse employees rate you, so you better keep your mouth shut. Your schedule will constantly change and so will your assigned role/job. You will work your off days frequently, expected to come in when there are hurricanes and major storms/flood. Really no concern for your safety. Let me rephrase, no concern for managements safety. Supervisors vacations are determined by seniority, do not expect to get and holidays off if you’re new. I once had a union employee tell me he was going to let something slide and not report me. Want to know what it was over? Because he didn’t want to be on the forklift anymore and i asked someone slightly less senior to him to do a job. Basically if you’re okay with working your life away with very little reward, this is the perfect job for you.] =",terrible,bad,bad

[pros: Three very talented desk managers that are dedicated to helping you out getting you to your quota and making a paycheck. Excellent finance department and service department. A handful of very helpful and morally sound sales associates.
cons: The ownership fosters a culture of skating. They do not care if sales associates, especially those with seniority, take credit and thus, money from you by claiming that they were involved in a deal in which they had zero input. There is even a report in the CRM that shows the same two employees who have the overwhelming majority and a drastically higher number of ""Skate Alerts"" than the rest of the staff. They ignore blatant violations of their own employee handbook of employees stealing deals, and if you are in the crosshairs of losing your job, they will not warn you, they will not write you up.

[pros: CRGs, learn about health navigation, and benefots that are available (but unable to use).
cons: Each August, hours go up . However, as March/April approaches the hours go drastically down. I've witnessed high employee turnover from hour cuts. The staff is working in a state of high anxiety. It is not healthy. It drains you of your mental and physical health. As a retail level employee, you seldom finish a day of work feeling accomplished. Instead, your day ends with a sense of feeling defeated.
While they do offer employee resource groups, retail staff are unable to become active members for their own growth. Talent is hidden at retail levels. This organization knows how to polish its glass ceilings (some enterpise and corporate colleagues), but ignore their dirty floors (retail level workers).

cons: When the old MD left and a new 'C' suite of so called leaders joined the company they have between them wiped over half the value of the company off the books. These so called leaders have reduced the company to a mere small sized company struggling to survive. It doesn't know in which way it is heading and is lost. It allows for two of the board to be in a personal relationship (finance and HR) and promoted one of them to the board in full knowledge of this. The CEO is way out of his depth and as for the CRO and CTO they genuinely haven't got a clue.

[pros: * The pay is average for London. There are some benefits like discounts etc but they are nothing to write home about
* If you are luck enough to be placed in a good team, there's the chance to work with some decent tech and good practices
* A longstanding business that's probably not going away any time soon, even if they are in decline over a longer timeframe. Your job is probably safe for 10 years at least
* Sainsbury's diversity and inclusion efforts are surprisingly good. They're pretty active in supporting different backgrounds, educating colleagues and also speaking up if colleagues act insensitively. However, this only goes so far: senior leadership is still very overwhelmingly white, middle-class, English and male.
cons: * Sainsbury's are one of those business that like to say they are agile, but really all the planning above developer level is waterfall, with multi-year plans, ""enterprise architects"" who don't code prescribing details years ahead of implementation. Short term planning basically doesn't happen. Imagine all the downsides of waterfall with no benefit, plus no joined up thinking at a lower level
* There is a _huge_ resistance to software practices that have been considered standard in most other businesses for decades at this point, including: automated testing, CI/CD, agile, UX testing (with actual users)
* Lots of people-churn, in the projects I've worked on, average tenure seems to be around six months
* There's a pervasive attitude of ""software developer == code typer"" in the company, meaning that feedback, ideas, solutions etc from lowly developers are ignored in favour of (often badly thought out or bizarrely ill fitting) ideas from middle-manages with no real-world experience
* Middle-management, eg. tech leaders on projects are, in my experience, either non-technical people with some management skills but who fail to understand technical requirements and caveats, or have been ""out of the game"" for too long and only understand very outdated practices
* Senior management are - to say this neutrally - out of touch. There are regular all-hands meetings with senior management, however the tone from senior leaders is extremely condescending, especially when answering people's concerns regarding Brexit, Covid, ways of working and the future of the company. Senior leaders (who are all white and middle-aged, 90% male) sit in their home offices overlooking massive gardens in their countryside home, telling the staff who are sat in bedrooms in house shares how we're ""all in this together"" 
* Covid response has been mediocre. I feel like the company has done the bare minimum to support staff. For example, there are allowances for equipment to work at home like a mouse, monitor, etc, but the spending limits are so comically low as to be useless, eg. a maximum of £7 for a mouse, which buys basically the cheapest non-ergonomic mouse from Argos with staff discount and that's it. The company's lack of support for staff who have family overseas and who have asked for permission to work from abroad is appalling. They have refused to grant permission and refused to explain why they won't allow this. The overall feeling is that the company is run by mean-spirited bean counters who only care about staff wellbeing in the sense that high staff turnover costs them money.
* The company's efforts for social causes like Covid and the environment are ""good enough"" and the company could do a LOT more. ""Carbon neutral by 2040"" is a pathetically unambitious target, and exists solely so the company can look like they are doing something.] =",neutral,bad,excellent

cons: Not a great career progression path at this time during a pandemic, a ton of work and not enough people to do it, not a lot of financial motivation for people who rely on bonuses and other financial incentives (discounts on travel etc.) as the pandemic has forced the company to scrap all these for the time being at least.] =",good,excellent,bad

[pros: Great learning opportunities, you work with literally the best people in the industry, working at salesforce is like getting your MBA in sales. Good base if you negotiate well. Products are great & industry leading. If you are able to build good relationships you will have pretty cool discussions with VPs and higher up. Also tons of great tools for support. Your SEs are pretty solid too.
cons: Salesforce experienced so much growth that there are a lot of resources missing, many teams in FINS are sharing SEs, many co-prime reps are missing. Lack of internal resources can actually hold up your deals and then management will get upset at you if they push. Management style here is odd. There are some managers who are extremely by the book and lack empathy and then there are others who are more loose and understanding. No in-between there. The compensation is good, but making your number at salesforce is insanely difficult even for experienced reps. The first year there you will get subpar accounts that have not had a lot of attention or have attrited. If you can make it past the first 1 1/2 things get better. Not a lot of the salespeople make money like they used to. Core AEs have a tough time and get so much thrown at them that it causes you to lose focus. Work life balance can be extremely challenging there's always some sort of training & with 15-20 client meetings per week plus 8-15 internals per week you can easily work 60-80 hours per week.] =",excellent,excellent,bad

[pros: Some great people work here (the worker bees) that want great things for this company, longevity here if you are ok with no growth and not being heard. More for those that just want to be comfortable and quiet.
cons: Ever watch that Disney short film called PURL? This is what it is like. All white men, dated methods of running a business, men making decisions but NOT making decisions. Meetings for days about the same thing but no one will pull the trigger until the very last minute, and when it isn't successful NO ONE is accountable. Their main customer base are women, yet not one women in this company has a voice. They pretend to be inclusive, that they are listening to the opinions of the amazing women they do have in upper management (a handful), but they go and change all the ideas to make it their own and at the LAST MINUTE make make approvals and expect their people to make it happen. The ads they have chosen usually do not make sense nor do they attract the audience they should be focused on, because they won't listen to the talented women that they have on staff. I cannot tell you how many people I knew that still have no idea who or what Hunter Douglas is as a brand, yet they literally have Hunter Douglas blinds in their homes!! How is that possible?? Think about that. 
DO NOT work here if you have great ideas, are a millennial, have ovaries, are excited and enthusiastic, and want a modern fast paced work environment.  They will shoot it down and go with their own. The one's in charge are not true leaders, but can sell you the Brooklyn bridge as they do to the CEO who buys it all and doesn't care to really see the truth of the last several years, therefore no one questions them or goes against them. The very few good folks there have been pushed aside and silenced still remain there for the most part. If you just want to get a paycheck and sit behind a desk not make any real contributions, this is the place for you. Is business good? Sure, when you monopolize the industry how can it not be, but damn this can be so so  so much more.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Free food if they don't make you stay until 12:30 am, easy to get the job, fun staff to work with
cons: Forced to work when I was sick. Constantly scheduled outside my availability, couldn't accommodate a basic college schedule. Didn't pay me for training like they were legally required to. Asked for 20 hours and was forced to work 35. Working until 10:00 pm (close shift) really means working until 11:30 pm or 12:30 am. Even if the store is empty and it is ""during peak"" you can't grab a drink and have to ask permission from a manager like you're a school kid. Can't use the bathroom for more than two minutes without managers pounding on the walls to get you to come back. Forced to give customers an embarrassingly small amount of food and then have to argue with them that it's our standard portion size. Pro tip- if 50% of your customers feel cheated when buying their food because there's barely any meat on it, that's not a good look Chipotle.] =",terrible,bad,terrible

[pros: Great, knowledgeable co-workers. Usually a fair and mostly drama-free place to work. Large breadth of ages from lifers who've worked there 35+ years to green college kids; sort of like a friendly and supportive engineering villiage. Engineers run the show here, for better or worse.
cons: Since engineers run the show, well-executed projects that are commercial flops are common. On top of this, printing is becoming more and more untenable as a place to compete. It's already mostly a commodity, but with resellers eating into the inky life-blood there are shrinking pains aplenty at HP.

Benefits are fairly good for a grocery store if you are able to utilize them.

Tuition reimbursement
cons: Health insurance is pretty bad
Injury CSs are highly overworked with large inventories & complex handling, should be about half of what they currently have
To become a manager it usually takes years within the same role and is very likeliness based, not competency or achievement based
I’m hearing pay scale is lower than other orgs and with more work (which is why I’m on this app right now LOL)
Raises are always mediocre - its more lucrative to get promoted than to get a high rating
They’re introducing in-office work again with little options to stay at home, meaning you’re making even less than before after accounting for expenses. They’re calling it “hybrid” for now but i don't expect that to stay the same

[pros: WFA , untill client has any obstruction
cons: was in UAE Bank Project, so review is based on what was faced: 

1. Mngrs and Bsiness Anlyst do not have proper understanding of the requirements , with that they want the dev. to complete the task in given time frame.

2. Mngr would ask the estimate of the task but even after justifying it , they will ask you to work 11-12 hours per day to complete the estimate hours in short time.

3. No proper UI/UX Team they have. Simply the BA says the flow or UI and the mngr decide whether it's write or wrong.

4. They will say before joining the organisation/project that  "" agile is followed, and have global team"" etc etc , but actually they do not follow. They have the Jira boards just to show off ,they still work and ask to update status in an excel sheet...

5. No motivation to join the organisation level or fun activities call. They never tell to a new joiner about anything, as if a new joiner is already knowing everything about the organisation.

6. No introduction among the team members or no farewell meeting or any information. Simply, they message personally about the last day in the project and that's it. 

7. They just show off to the outer world about the good things but inside very rarely it reaches to employees.

8. The HR won't respond to your messages . had joined the organisation and next week had some questions related to leaves . pinged HR twice but even after seeing the messages she didn't reply.

9. If you raise a ticket to know something they won't resolve on time. For an example i had an issue to avail the flexi leave but the portal was having issues, i raised the ticket regarding that and i got a reply from the team a month later. 
I missed my flexi leave as well due to their late reply.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Footlocker has given me many levels of experience. The right managers will teach you how to ensure customer satisfaction, how to handle an upset customer, how to be accommodating how to provide and gain loyalty. There are many different things you can learn to do if given the opportunity. You can learn to use the register, stock inventory, communicate with associates as a teacher, open and closing the store, ordering items , looking up transactions. It’s a great place to get a taste of how to run inventory, deal with transactions as well as interacting with people.
cons: The downside of working at footlocker, is there is little growing room as far as moving up in positions. If there is no positions open you will not be promoted no matter how hard you work. And regardless of how much you give and how hard you work, the pay remains the same. The pay is minimal; it remains the same whether you are there for 1 year or for 5 as long as you’re in that same position, at the same time every quarter they add on more expectations.] =",excellent,good,bad

[pros: Benefits and pay were decent.
cons: Fifty percent turnover. Supervisor was very incompetent, lacking education and proper skills, and never following appropriate practices. Employees in two call centers gossiped regularly on Teams chat about co workers. Supervision and management didn't support agents. They no longer took escalation calls. Has a so called ""Speech and Quality"" team. They didn't like accents from other states, constantly making comments about ""tone and approach."" Always was told by supervisor ""receiving email complaints about you from employees"" but would never produce them in print. They lower the bar in hiring practices; after several weeks the newbies can't do the work. Supervisor threatened employees with ""receiving emails from other employees about behavior"" yet would never produce those emails in print. Very negative environment. Decided after this latest experience in a Minnesota workplace it is time to leave the state. Just too insular workplace practices and if you speak with a different accent, you are criticized.

[pros: When I first started I was paid for two months to sit at home on Bench (doing absolutely nothing) while they assigned me to a client. This allowed me to get a head start on my master's degree. The benefits aren't bad for a service company, with 5% 401k matching and decent medical. I also received a $2,500 retention bonus for surviving one year, but it didn't make up for being massively underpaid. Whatever rate you join at is where you will stay, so be sure to negotiate up front. I found out I was making 35% less than my coworkers for the same work. I knew it was time to leave when I confronted management, who kept lying, saying a raise was ""coming soon.""
cons: Infosys is an Indian IT service company that hasn't quite figured out how the American job market functions. I took this position as a last resort because COVID killed the job market in 2020 and I had recently relocated to Oregon. HR is pretty poor and onboarding was difficult. They kept losing employment records; I had to submit my I-9, proof of education and COVID vaccination card multiple times. Management is a complete joke. My ""managers"" were in other states and forgot who I was and where I was working, several times. They had no clue what the client requirements were or who was doing what. I had 4 different managers in the 2 years I worked for Infosys. Management completely ignores you until they need something.

In many ways, Infosys is a typical service company: there are no reviews, no raises, no promotions. The difference is, they expect you to do pretty much everything for yourself: weekly timecards, HR, IT, productivity stats, finding new projects, etc. They even have a self-guided system to separate from the company! Their systems are not intuitive and look like they were developed in 1995. the company-provided laptop took 20 minutes to boot to a useable state. The company constantly sent these weird MLM emails, advertising itself to its own employees. Not sure what that was about, but my Outlook rule list to filter them out was huge, by the time I left. Maybe that's why my laptop was so slow...

Project deliverables and training were front-run to meet deadlines. Staffing levels and workloads were inappropriate, with some sites understaffed and others overstaffed. Infosys puts people on random projects with zero regard for education, competency, or job title. They just need bodies in chairs, to bill the client. I'm a systems analyst by trade and have a BS in Information Systems, yet they stuck me on an infrastructure team doing L1 hardware support. It was a total waste of my time and I learned next to nothing. Since there was so much downtime at the client, I was able to work out, study, and focus on finding a real job. Besides, it's a bad idea to stay at any service company for longer than a year or two.

To conclude, Infosys might be okay for some kid fresh out of school, or someone making a career change into IT, who doesn't mind being lowballed in exchange for industry experience. However, Infosys only offers temporary, dead-end jobs and they should be treated as such. Get in, get a paycheck and a bit of experience then get out, ASAP. Preferably, join the client you are working at. Infosys earns a 1 star rating because of the benefits but in all other aspects, it's a Zero-star company. I definitely wouldn't recommend working there if you are an experienced IT professional.

cons: Whilst most junior roles are occupied by women after a certain level the roles are mainly filled by men.

[pros: Shifts are flexible for the most part Discount is decent
cons: A lot is expected for minimum wage. Providing great customer service isn't enough. They want you to be an expert in every area of the store and live and breathe Indigo. They check in on this in awkward one on one meetings with management 4 times a year where you're encouraged with a bunch of made up buzz words. Minimum wage employees encouraged to take on additional responsibilities (sometimes similar to what a manager would be doing) and join various comittees with no pay increase. Indigo recently made a decision to cut down on management team size, so this is only going to get worse. They talk a big game about things like diversity and sustainability, but it's mostly in service of the brand's public image. In practice all the company cares about is money. Employee safety and well-being comes last (unless it can be put on display to make Indigo look good), especially for BIPOC & LGBTQ2+ employees. A lot of pressure to sell premium memberships with very little compensation Extremely high management turnover. Each new management team turns the store upside down and changes the work environment completely. Some have been incredible, but it never lasts for long. I think there's a lot of pressure from higher up.] =",bad,bad,bad

cons: it is one of the worst job interviews I have experienced.

The interview was always easy and repeated questions but I don't even get a job even if it is an entry-level job like a cashier, or a little needed more experience all just deny after 3 days. I got 4 interviews for 4 different jobs and rejected all. If you do not need a person who speaks English as a second language speaker to apply for a job just put the title upfront so that people don't apply for a job. This is one of the most ridiculous companies with a ridiculous hiring sign but never hiring a person. Keep applying and keep denying every single time even with a good background.

[pros: Good salary paid each month
Nice building
cons: Not even sure where to begin but if you are a professional, run away because this company is a sad black hole and will add nothing but ridicule to your CV.

Management has absolutely no clue what they are doing and when working/showing up, only do so to play fake politics and blame people junior on anything they have woken up to that day.
There is one senior person in particular that is already getting a reputation in Bangkok for being a drunk and a ladies’ bar patron, hanging out with secretaries whilst his wife is at home. Everyone their own but when you then show up on a down at work, irritable and yelling at people or falling asleep during meetings, that does not fit right with being a leader.
He is just an example among many sadly.

Curiosity and honesty are values that are being discouraged immediately as they have no place in a company where no one can take initiative or tell president Supachai that a business is down 90% and in need of a serious strategy shift.

Women and non-Thais are seen as perhaps a token to show the company is more than just Thai. Make no mistake: it is more Thai than a pad Thai, with limited IQ, passive aggressive behaviours, and a rampant lose-face culture.

There is nothing at this company: no data (!!!), no cutlery, no pen, no notepads… you have to bring your own mouse and keyboard… no smart people, no achievement, no working people… seriously this is a black hole.

Unfortunately, I have been through the worst experience of my working life and would warn anyone against joining this joke of a company. People are already leaving left and right and the company is having huge issues recruiting. A lot are only staying until they find a new job.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Good foot in the door to the industry, since the company is a big corporation and all that entails.
cons: Firstly, management is non-existent, in a literal sense. As a Contract RA you don't speak with Biogen management directly, but rather to a proxy contract recruiting organization. They also pay you, so make sure to button up the details of your pay when you start, and if you believe you have something more to offer than you're worth, Biogen may be desperate enough to negotiate for that. The team you're on will truly treat you the same as a salaried hire which is respectful of them. At the same time, it is difficult because you may work just as hard as full-time employees but not be compensated as well. Also, your team may not be great so being treated the same is not necessarily good. The chances are high that your manager will be very cagey about if they can offer you a full-time position, so if you end up doing good work and are there for a while it will probably be frustrating. The other con is that because you are employed in this weird zone you'll feel ""siloed"" in your team, in a situation where no one outside your team wants to interact with you. All this amounts to a bad employment structure, so no, I do not recommend contract work.] =",good,neutral,bad

[pros: Can literally do nothing all day and charge whatever you want. Management doesn’t care about reporting misscharging. Job security because no one wants to work here, so they don’t fire anyone, even if you have multiple security violations. Their benefits are pretty solid with having 3-4 weeks of vacation a year (if u are in Camden) - other locations have unlimited.
cons: Camden office is a joke. No rewards. Everyone just goes through the day with not a care in the world while 2 or 3 people carry the company on their back. No one stays more than a year because they realize how bad the company is within the first 2 months. Senior developers getting paid roughly 130k to edit white space while junior/member devs have to pick up the slack. They never give out bonuses nor salary bumps (other than 1-3% at the end of the year) so there is no point in trying your hardest.] =",good,bad,bad

[pros: Novosco as it was formerly known was a great place to work. Innovation was massively encouraged and often rewarded fairly. Everyone felt part of the what seemed like ever growing family with new deals etc being won celebrated by everyone.
cons: Cancom or Novosco as it was formerly known has went through some severe changes/acquisitions in the past 2 years which has now resulted in a massive ""brain drain"" in the organisation with many key and very talented staff leaving. After being promised multiple times of levelling up in regards to salaries etc which have never happened many have packed up and headed for other firms. Unbelievably no action has been taken by the MD to resolve or even address this and instead employees are told that ""this level of staff turnover is a good thing to bring new blood into the company"" On previous occasions staff were unbelievably told ""that if they didn't like it then off they should go"". Not really what you would expect to hear from SMT.

The SMT only really talk about sales as thats all they really care about. Employees are now an afterthought which was never the case in the Novosco days.] =",neutral,bad,bad

For the last 4-6 big holidays such as Christmas, thanksgiving, employee appropriation day the workers got nothing..not a $5 Tim’s card, not a cookie, not a $5 Longo’s card… NOTHING.

[pros: It used to be the people I worked with, but it seems that 85% of them have left, not by pull factors from their new opporunities but largely from push factors within.
Clients have been interesting and big brand names, but seems that there's been a mini exodus of big brand names over the last few years.
cons: Abysmal pay - new pay bands introduced but blatant lies to those who now fall outside the new bands whose pay was then not adjusted to fit, allegedly. 
Poor communication - they try so hard with regional and global meetings but it's nothing but buzzwords and business guff.
Awful HR who of course protect the company above all else. Very obviously cliquey and hard to trust.
Cliquey senior leadership as well.
CSR initiatives mostly just for show - afraid to make any difficult option of taking a stand and only picks and chooses causes to look good. Fair enough, it's a business, but then stop pretending.
Constant merging, consistent growing pains with no positive changes to our work environment.
Lots of issues with resource as people leave and there is trouble filling roles, outsourcing to other smaller offices where salaries are cheap is not the way, neither is hiring contractors just to fill gaping holes in your teams.
Morale is low and people are getting more and more cynical.
You need to push, hard and all the time for any chance of progression, which largely seems to stem from middle managers being way too busy to prioritise people management due to client commitments.] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: Easy job if you always say 'yes' to the extra work that your manager does not want to do. Say no and well...

Salary is decent for the required work.
cons: Your schedule for the year is determined in Q4 with metrics that are not released until at the start of Q4. So the only way to have a normal work-life balance is to be there long enough to gain a tenure team. Otherwise you are starting from ground zero with a fresh poorly performing team. Picture being told 3/4 of the year you are doing a great job, then the metrics that determine your future schedule, think 3-10 PM Tuesday-Wednesday off, comes up and your manager will tell you looks like you aren't doing a good job better make those numbers before your performance review. 

Managers will micro-manage every moment they can and confront you if you are not productive enough by 'their standards' not based on performance at all. It pays to do slow work and stretch out your 40+ hour work week. The longer it shows you working the better you are in their eyes.

Ageism at its best. Anyone can see that if you look at the managerial team. Education does not matter because every manager only has a high school diploma and it shows very quickly. I'm not being condescending I am simply stating the truth. Skills do not matter. Loyalty for 10+ years and kissing all your bosses a**es in the same position is the only way to get promoted.

Managers treat each supervisor different depending on their capabilities. Your co-worker could have a team 5 and you could have one of 15 and be paid the same but expected to do less because that is all 'they are capable of'. 

The best of all if you want to be a detective and get off on firing people that take medical time off and wait for them to slip up in their documentation or say the wrong thing. Then this is the job for you. 

Managers task supervisors to find who writes bad survey responses about them. On top of that supervisors are told up-front they have to put 10s only otherwise they have no 'backbone'. And if the over manager score goes too low we have a team 'talking to' about owning our issues.

For career development you can't go anywhere because the reputation of call center employees is so bad in the company (and for a good reason) that no one will even entertain you for a phone screen for another role. 

If you want leadership experience work anywhere else. A 2-3% raise every year is not worth your sanity.] =",bad,terrible,good

After that they will hold the threat of termination over your head constantly. I once lost a wallow talkie that had clipped off my shirt and into a box being thrown into the dumpster. With no better instructions than “Well you better go do something.” I had to, for lack of a better term, dumpster dive into my store dumpster to retrieve my walker. In the process my hand was sliced on broken glass pretty badly. When I informed them again of what had then transpired they basically scolded me, had me fill out the necessary forms, and proceeded to tell me there was a procedure I was supposed to follow and that they “never” would tell me to just go get it.

[pros: Corporate training was amazing. Great training Team. Awesome foundation to be very successful.
cons: Each recruiter will be placed within a division also known as a specialization where you will focus on specific roles in a specific field. Examples of the different divisions are risk & security, digital, Java/.Net, financial, state & local government, and a few others. That being said each recruiter will have a Lead/ Mentor. In general, this is a very individual competitive type of job. But at the same time, you are working as a team to generate business. Making sure your lead/mentor is a good coach is super important. Just like a coach on a sports team to succeed they need to know how to train different individuals/athletes. Not being able to train or mentor can be a huge disadvantage for those newer to the recruiting field. That being said my lead was newly promoted to a lead and I was her first mentee. I liked her as a person but she was limited in her ability to train/coach. In other words, she only knew how to teach how she communicated. It was very this way or the highway. The beauty of being a recruiter is no two people are alike. The more you learn how to be yourself and create your brand the better set off you will be. There is for sure an advantage in being placed in a division having a good team of people makes all the difference.] =",good,excellent,excellent

Not the best place to work, but not the worst. They say they are holistic and provide spiritual care, but by that they mean Catholic care.

[pros: - Support is a great place to learn! Lots of training, resources, and opportunity to move around and learn whatever technology you prefer
- Fairly laid back and friendly environment
cons: Nearly everything surrounding pay is concerning:

- Pay is not competitive (the argument being that the benefits are good, so this can be low)
- Raises don't always meet inflation
- Pay structures are not transparent - folks have come in with the same experience but were offered different compensation
- Negotiating higher pay is discouraged when going for internal promotions (e.g. analyst to specialist)

When I began asking questions about pay transparency and equity, I was told the following by various managers:

- Do not discuss salaries with each other
- I would ""never get the answers I was looking for"" with concerns about gender pay inequity
- I was ""not wanted"" in my Group Lead position if I were to keep asking questions
- I was ""wasting company money"" by having meetings with HR and Management to discuss pay concerns
- Advocating for an analyst to negotiate a higher pay when moving to a specialist position was ""wrong""
- I received a raise due to a promotion at the same time as yearly merit, and management was not able to specify how much I was receiving for either individual portion

Culturally, Esri does not always live up to its reputation either:

- ERGs receive no meaningful support (i.e. money) for they work they do that the company will broadcast and showcase
- I was told to take down an internal post about inclusive language guidelines because ""someone could fear they get in trouble for using the wrong term""] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: You will acquire a multitude of skills, ranging from storytelling to data analytics. The people working there are dedicated, professional, and extremely hard working.

cons: In short, the company doesn't care about you. You are an easily replaceable number to them, and it shows in their hesitation to promote, retain, and reward. No matter how much you contribute or how long you've contributed, your say doesn't really matter in the end; most decisions are in hands of a few people. 

A lot of work time is expected to dedicate to internal activities instead of actual client work and professional development.

[pros: I can't think of any.
cons: Ownership lacks commercial sales experience outside of BF resulting in poor to no collateral, overly cumbersome price approval process, poor reporting structure and scattered direction on what a CSC is to them. The job does not match the description advertised. It is not like working in a national company. CSC reports to a branch manager plumber with little to no sales leadership experience to the magnitude you need. CSC movement is not a field sales job. It is whatever job description the manager gives you after you take the job and all CSC's are not treated equally. If the manager tells you to work in the office, clean a bathroom or clean up the storage rooms, you have to. If you raise any notice to anyone including HR you will be fired immediately. You are micromanaged and tracked by your phone, your manager, and your car 40 hours a week and its stressful. You may not use your company car outside of work. Subservience and working like you are making a base salary of $70,000 is what they expect. You hit or exceed goals there is no bonus and no incentive.

The guidelines are never clear or ever explained to anyone ever. The rules are never explained. The commission structure is never explained clearly and never ready until halfway through each calendar year so we have no idea how we are getting paid the 1st half of the year.

They love to constantly provide opportunities for the whole office to go out and get hammered, provide a steady flow of excuses to drink in the office, etc.
cons: This company is a revolving door of ambitious young business grads promised to get rich quick by making an enormous amount of phone calls during their 12+ hour days of “selling” terrible jobs. If you are one of the few selected favorites of one of the account managers, they may take you under their wing. Then, and only then will you have a great opportunity to exclusive easy-to-fill reqs. If not, well then you’ll be on a 12 hour hamster wheel of phone calls all day making money for your account manager and taking home pennies. They will make you stay late, come in on weekends, do whatever it takes to get their lame jobs filled. Keep in mind you’re convincing people to leave their job to take a terrible job that the company that hired Aerotek was unable to fill. Typically because the job sucks.] =",excellent,bad,bad

[pros: Benefits package is decent if you've never been in a job that offered them before. On-site cafeteria, convenience store, gym, and health clinic
cons: Felt like I was back in high school. Management was very cliquish and really emphasized social connections in our department. People who didn't fit in were often belittled. Hiring decisions were made based more on personality and whether applicants would fit in socially than any qualifications they did or didn't have.

A large group a young people to experience all the crazy things you will experience. Big sense of camaraderie among fellow coworkers. Work hard play hard culture.
Move bonus each time you move with the company.

Sink or swim attitude. Can be seen as a pro or a con, but you are immediately held accountable. Baptize by fire culture.
While you got a lot of paid time off, it's often difficult to request and get approved on fast-paced jobs. You will compete with people who travel far or have seniority for time off.

[pros: There is a lot to learn in this organization, but you wont find the time to learn anything. You wont even be able to do any continuous education since the job will take away all of your time. But there is a lot to learn and understand in this organization.
cons: I work at Everest in IT, and feel like the senior management is very arrogant. Being a small firm, everyone has visibility to the senior management and they too have visibility in the day to day job. Employee motivation and empathy are totally absent in IT and instead threat is used to get the work done. Not a single day will pass when the senior Management will not remind you that your job is at risk, and if you are a contractor it is more often than that. Even when they are asking you to do overtime or work over the weekend, which is almost every weekend for some, they wont request but issue it as a dictum or a threat, for no fault of yours. 

Coming to the culture, it is a blame game culture and the loudest wins. One department is pitted against another and every time there is blame trading that happens when anything goes south. There is a complete lack of maturity from the management and they seem to, most of the times, even encourage such behavior.

[pros: - Learning experience
- Variety of projects
- Good place to start your career (only from an experience perspective)
cons: This review is for KPMG in Singapore, Advisory.

Where do I even begin? I would advise against reading any one-liner reviews you see on sites like Glassdoor. 

1. REMUNERATION AND STAFF RETENTION

It is a no-brainer that Big 4 pays below market especially for fresh graduates but you have no idea how appalling it can be for KPMG in Singapore. The Advisory pay structure is practically Audit pay structure with minor adjustments (Disclaimer: Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of very intelligent, friendly, nice, people in Audit but the value of Audit work in general cannot be compared to Advisory work, even though Audit revenues are generally steadier and less volatile than Advisory).

Hence, standard practice is to accept job offers here as a safety net, and then renege when you get better offers elsewhere. Even after starting work, juniors continuously apply to test the market for better offers. I know people who quit on the first day, after two weeks, within two months, within a year: so really, any time.

So junior turnover is extremely high. And you can imagine the burden this has on engagement delivery: juniors quit, teams have to re-hire, and then re-train the new hire. But while managers are training the new person, it means they have to help out on the grunt work themselves on top of the massive responsibilities they have as managers on admin, compliance, client management, etc. Eventually these managers themselves also quit.

It's a house of cards, really. How bad is the situation? In the Consulting arm of Advisory, some teams only have 1 to 3 juniors remaining (people who are Assistant Managers and below). Many people, especially juniors, left during and after an incredibly disappointing series of townhalls. First, people were promoted without a pay increase. Later, a pay increase was instituted for half a year, and only at half the amount of standard increments (i.e. half increment for half a year). No back-payment was promised. Can you imagine the disappointment? Yes, COVID made it difficult. But imagine a firm that cannot afford you a pay more despite already paying you so much lower than market average.

So I don't get why it is so difficult for management to understand the need to pay their staff better. It's even funnier when you discover some partners apparently believe that they pay above market. Their source? ""A recruiter told me."" The recruiter either has something against KPMG or is making you believe it in the hopes that this will indirectly cause unhappiness for some of your employees eventually, in turn making it easy for recruiters to target.

When my peers and juniors have become jaded at this company, I encourage them to look for jobs. I even know of people in other teams who forward job postings to their fellow teammates (manager to associate, for example). This is the toxic environment this firm has become although we have no malicious intent. We just want to support our colleagues who have become our friends.

2. JUNIOR PARTNERS HAVE A TOUGH LIFE TOO

When I say management, I really mean only senior partners and above. Junior partners and below have a terrible life. Junior partners find themselves trapped between resolving their team's problems and the need to avoid getting on the bad side of the more senior partners who are important to their career prospects (e.g. relationships with key accounts, relationships with industry, relationships within the broader global KPMG network).

When someone quits, junior partners ask ""How can I make your life better?"", and if the answer is ""Pay me higher"", they can only respond ""Sorry, even I can't do that for you.""] =",good,terrible,bad

[pros: people I worked with were great. Higher ups had both good and negative points.

[pros: The benefits here are amazing! Competitive wages, bonuses, free and discounted Uber trips and orders on Uber Eats, and other free services like Navia and Lyra.
cons: Uber's sick time and leave policies are ridiculously strict considering the pandemic and the fact that many of their teams are understaffed right now due to massive layoffs. 

Their leadership teams are inexperienced, (borderline incompetent,) and lack empathy for their staff. They engage in practices such as workplace bullying, retaliation for reports to HR, blatant fraternization (amongst leadership and subordinates,) and favoritism as a result. The high performers are not rewarded for the hard work, and promotions and manger references are granted only to those who get along with them on a social level. If you make a complaint, favor will automatically fall on the members of the leadership team and those they engage with outside of work.

The company's branches, (engineering, community operations, executive, etc.) operate completely independently of each other, and the comm ops branch is treated like dirt. If you work in the Greenlight Hub you can pretty much expected to be treated like a second class citizen. They even opted to stay open during an active stay at home advisory (after a spike in covid-19 infections) in Chicago, while their other branches were allowed to work safe from home.

While Uber boasts being a ""diverse"" company, their own recent report showed that most of the positions in leadership and tech at the company are filled by white men. Black and latino employees are still underrepresented in almost every sector of this company outside of customer support.] =",bad,bad,excellent

[pros: You will get to work with some very cool people and there will be some awesome customers that you will meet. Some even give tips big and small. If you can handle working on at a McDonald’s then I can assure you, you can work anywhere most likely.
cons: If in a busy area you are constantly doing $800 to $1000 hours back to back which is very stressful. If understaffed then you may be taking orders, money, bagging food, and handing food out of the window all at once while your manager shifts from the kitchen to the front floor trying to make the drive through move as fast as it can. You will be working with more teenagers than adults which I almost guarantee which can be fun coming from a teenager, but there will be some who lack so much common sense that you wish you could fire them and they will sometimes fool around a little to much and be off task. You are very limited on what you may have on your break and I was told the only reason we get our one free meal a shift is only because of covid (the owners are very stingy and cheap people most of the time). THERE ARE NO DISCOUNTS WHEN YOU ARE OFF THE CLOCK. You will most likely be yelled at at least one time per shift. I almost forgot customers. So here’s the deal customers can be very sweet but also awful. Some do not realize that with only three people running the store and one of them being 16 that we make mistakes. We can’t help that we are extremely understaffed and overworked. Some will be violent and physically/verbally scary and it can be a little traumatic. Some may be very rude or try to degrade you. Some will make you uncomfortable in ways you didn’t know could. If any of this happens please just walk away and tell your manager because some of the things that I’ve been told are definitely not worth hearing. THEY WILL ALSO INTEND FOR YOU TO TRAIN PEOPLE, BUT WILL NOT GIVE YOU THE HIGHER PAY AS A CREW TRAINER.] =",neutral,neutral,bad

[pros: Quick learning on- ramp. Flexible hours 24 x 7 x 365 open schedule. Can earn without lmits up to a point based on effort and hours worked. Sales calls are incoming from customers wanting to buy or question.
cons: All calls are tracked and calls for reasons other than sales count against your sales figures. One product had technical problem with robo calls and out of 40 calls, I had one that actually was a call for the product. The other calls counted against my sales for that product. 
Sales figures and adherence to 30 minute attendance schedules determine the number of incoming calls, which are the only means to sell. 
The Schedule program can slowly get off correct time as much as 45 minutes to 2 hours and you can miss 30 minute start times causing your stats to lower which control call volume. Sounds simple but in a fast paced phone volume, loosing track of time is easy as calls go beyond your scheduled 30 minute slot so you have to refer to the schedule program quickly and react. Lower call volume creates lower sales opportunities and potential pulling of your contract.] =",neutral,neutral,bad

[pros: Pay, the only thing that keeps me at coles is the pay.
cons: There are so many cons to working at coles, the environment is extremely toxic. I remember when I first joined they gave me a whole bunch of online training which did not train me well at all and did not help me a single bit when I was working. I came and they just threw me into the deep end. Don't get me started on the managers, there are two of them and they are the most shallow and conceited people I know. It's very obvious they are talking behind your back about the new employees. Another thing about coles is that you are not allowed to go to the bathroom during a shift I have not even once asked in my 6 months of working at coles to go to a bathroom but the one time I did they shut me down and neglected what I said. Is it not a basic human right to go to the bathroom when working. I am at my shift 10 mins earlier helping out but the one time I could not make it to a shift because I needed to catch the school bus I called them a day earlier and said I can't make it to my 4-7 but I will happily do 4:10-7:10 and they just cancelled my shift and started to give me one shift a week. You cant swap shifts and find another employee to do that with because you need to directly tell your manager and instead of helping you out they just straight-up cancel it.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

[pros: I feel they pay a decent salary (for my position), not the best, but decently competitive. The employees tend to be very caring, good, kind, and passionate about caring for patients. At a local level AH tends to be more understanding of the employees, but they are still required to follow corporate policy, and they still want to bring in revenue. Good CEU reimbursement benefit for providers.
cons: However, for this ""decent"" salary (mentioned above) I was expected to see more patients than what is ethically appropriate for my position. In other words, regardless of burnout or national association standards for patient volume, there is a quota that must be met. This “decent” salary has been competitive only within the past 1.5 years; prior to that, I had not received a raise in 5 years because “there was not a mechanism” to provide me with a raise even though my salary was well below market standards. In my opinion, Adventist Health (AH) cares more about profits, which is evident from hearing the corporate CFO and one local CFO use the term “profit” repeatedly in a company meeting. AH claims to be a non-profit, but the reality is that they are all for profit, but not for taxes. Right now, AH is struggling financially because of poor decisions by “corporate” (all finances are controlled centrally), but the whole of AH is paying the price, especially the lower-level employees. The hospital administration lacks accountability for their decisions. AH corporate is known to modify employee benefits policies without informing the employees of the changes, and then creating a new policy to fit these modifications only after they have caught. For example, if you leave the company prior to the end of the year, they will not contribute to your retirement plan for the entire fiscal year. (I found out about this policy change two months prior to my separation). Previously, an employee could separate from the company and if they worked any part of their final month, they would be covered under the company insurance for the rest of the month; but this, too, has changed. A coworker who was a director did not know about this rule change and found out about this change 2 weeks prior to retirement but while he was on leave, he left thinking that I had insurance coverage until the end of the month but did not. Finally, I have first-hand knowledge that company CFOs choose not to bring the hospital up to standards or code after it was cited in a Joint Commission survey, and a Life Safety survey because it would ""cost too much.""

I whole-heartedly support a company that wants to be fiscally responsible; however, I do not believe AH is responsible or responsive to their employees or patients. AH requires employees (and subsequently patients) to pay the price for corporate’s poor financial decisions. 

AH states that they are supportive of LGBT employees, but the AH insurance will not cover costs associated with care transgender care, and as a provider I was caught in the middle of such a battle trying where I was prevented from providing the standard of care] =",bad,bad,excellent

Training program is excellent and you’ll learn sales skills that can take you a lot of places if you work for it. I truly feel that Gartner is investing in my success not only for this job but for my career development.
cons: The training program (SOAR) felt unnecessarily long (2 months). However, they apparently are revamping their training so this might not be an issue for future hires. For 70% of the training days, we were done by 2-3PM with nothing else to do. For the first several months after going live on the sales floor, expect to put in long hours and work your butt off, especially if this is your first true sales role. The culture seems to be a little weird at times. I’ve heard about lots of office politics and drama from coworkers who have been here longer than me.

[pros: They Provide us equipment to use, bonus check. Small career opportunities
cons: most of the company is a Con, majority of what this company works and strives for is Executives and share holders. You will always hear about "" goals "" to which the execs and shareholders are looking for bigger checks and profits gained. if these goals are not met each quarter the money will be taken from the employees bonus checks. They do not pay a competitive market pay scale and really just pay the bare minimum roughly starting at 40k. i got a raise last year and this with inflation paid me 3% less than what i was making. The company will not take its workers needs or asks into a consideration as it would cut into profits. You will be placed in an office that was built in the 60's with minimal updates. Strong separation of workers including the work areas and company sponsored events ( will not let high end engineers and low bottom CSR's to mingle and share on company events. Company spends a lot of money on pointless things like upgrading the manufacturing or research labs that will only benefit a small amount of workers. A lot of bad with this company , okay place to start a career for experience but that's about all . Pretty bad at hiring in diversity unless its to do with a highly skilled position but for the most part its white people. Says that the office culture and the way we all collaborate are the best things. When at the office i spoke to my coworkers around 2 times a week. Unless you have a degree you'll never make it to a position that matters. The company struggles to keep employees as most of the tenured ones have retired. Most of the work will be put on to newer employees and you will be over worked and stressed out.] =",terrible,bad,bad

[pros: - The initial pay for most positions seems to be good. The increases afterwards are severely lacking, though.

- The benefits seem adequate to me.

- The hardware provided to employees is stellar in most cases, unless you receive a re-imaged laptop from another employee instead of a normal upgrade laptop.

- ""Unlimited"" vacation and reasonable sick time allowances.
cons: - No Work From Home Policy
 Absolutely archaic way of looking at the work from home situation. Took corporate FOREVER to finally allow work from home during the pandemic compared to other businesses of similar caliber and size. The official plan is to have employees come back to the office 3 days a week starting July 6th, 2021, and then full-time back in the office sometime in the fall, September/October time-frame. With no planned exemptions or flexibility involved. The WFH policy up until this point is essentially ""you can't"" unless you're legally required to be allowed to. They claim that working in the office is better for collaboration and teamwork and innovation, but as an employee both before and after being purchased by Honeywell, I can tell you there is almost NO collaboration or innovation going on, nor is it actually incentivized. They just like the buzzwords.

- No Upward Mobility
 You would think a company like this would be incredibly interested in keeping the younger generation around and attracting young, new talent and retaining them to replace the ""old guard"" when they move on or retire, but they don't remotely care and it's obnoxiously evident. They drag out promotions for nearly a year or more, if you even get one at all. They get incredibly stingy with the raises when they actually do give them. They don't seem interested in giving you a career path, just expect you to be happy you're where you are and to stay there.

- 401K Paid Out Once Per Year
 They only pay 401k match once a year in January, meaning you lose out on potential dividends. interest gains, and general gains over the course of the year that they could have been matching monthly. This also means if you leave at any point other than right after you receive your match, you miss out on potentially 11 months worth of 401k match funds.

- Furloughs and Cut Cost-of-Living Raises are the Norm
 It's very typical to be furloughed, even as an engineer, for anywhere from 1 week to 1 full month every year. That's a lot of time that you can't really plan for to go without a paycheck, and there's no telling when they decide the financials need to look better, so everyone should take one for the team. They also frequently find excuses to not offer the yearly cost-of-living wage increases; Usually it's that the financial performance hasn't been great, despite having just shown slides that seemed an awful lot like the company was doing pretty good.

- Inefficient, Silo'd Engineering & Lack of Training
 Almost all engineering teams work in silos all the time and team collaboration is just handled at the end when it has to be done, instead of integrating things throughout the course of development. There is also little to no training. If you ever do go through training, it's usually way to late to have ever been useful, but the training itself isn't usually actually helpful in the first place so it's really wouldn't matter.

- Heavy Focus on Short-Term Stockholder Gains
 Most of the town-halls and other company-wide meetings usually cover financials from a high-level perspective talking about how great we are usually doing, and quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year financial improvements. As well as how great this would be for the stockholders. This wouldn't be such an issue if it weren't for the people that make the business profitable (the sales teams and the engineering teams) weren't treated as a disposable meat grinder. There is no conversation had about employee retention or what could be helpful to keep employees, giving the impression to back up the evidence, that they couldn't care less whether you stay or go.

 - Lots of Broken Promises
 They frequently like to have ""surveys"" that a mysteriously large portion of the company report never receiving and use these surveys to justify the state of things, while making ""promises"" and ""plans"" on how to ""improve"" things that NEVER actually come to fruition in any way more than an abstract ""we should be doing this"" conversation in a town-hall.

- Hemorrhaging Employees
 Employee retention seems to be the last concern to upper-management. I've heard losses of engineering employees described as ""un-regrettable losses"". That speaks for itself.] =",good,bad,none

[pros: Good salary and benefits, management pays for meals sometimes too
cons: I resigned after 6 months and I was happy to leave. 

There was no onboarding program. There was no clarity on management expectations and what my role will look like. Things were constantly changing and there was no time for any proper communication. I didn't have a manager to report to for first 3 months, then a manager was hired who left after 3 months - he had no background in Instructional Design or Training. There was very high workload and work-life balance was not good. 

I requested for training and it was rejected even though the training was for a new type of ID work that was not discussed at the interview or documented in the job description. Lots of surprises, not very pleasant. 

As an ID, there was very little action taken based on best practices and data driven decision making. Decisions were made based on whatever the manager representing 'client' Samsung wanted. There was lots of micro aggression, no documented best practices and a top down approach focused on 'the client' manager instead of evidence based approach that shows what works and what doesn't work. 

If you are a fast paced worker who keeps quiet and does work exactly as the 'client' wants, then you're ok but if you ask questions or suggest other approaches, you may be subject to excessive criticism, passive aggressive behavior, blame game and abandonment.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: The pay and benefits are fair.
cons: Unless you have been in the military or had previous government experience, you will not be accepted into their culture. They are not big on remote work and the only reason it was put into effect is because of COVID-19. Cameras must be on so micro-management is very present. Consultants are constantly tasked with working on proposals for new business. This should be for marketing and sales, not consultants. Lots of politics between  primes and subs leaving those working in constant influx. For this reason there is a lot of turnover. This is not a place one could plan on staying for several years.

[pros: sometimes you find cool people and endure the suck together- creates friendships.
cons: Accenture is extremely hypocritical when they talk about approaching problems in a ""truly human"" way when they treat their staff as less than that. I have seen and worked with sexism more than once. Accenture doesn't push innovation, if you stay too long and don't push yourself outside work you will lose the skills you worked for as a developer and get stuck at the company- I see this all the time. Leadership will take credit for the work of others if they are below them. Bonus' and raises are a joke, borderline offensive for the hours you put in. I guess in hindsight the work/life balance is good because there is no real or interesting work to work on.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: On time salary but no incentives for store managers
cons: Basically a fraud organization. They hired from college campus selection. Then after 1 month of online training they have taken a test and deliberately marked me as failed and forced me to resign. They played with my career because it is not possible that a student who never used to fail in any of the exam in her academics will fail in their so called test as he cracked all the interview procedures and scored 8.2 cgpa in her masters. So this was a part of their politics. Also in the offer letter it was no where mentioned that a candidate have crack another exam to continue with this organisation. If this was the rule then it should have been mentioned in the offer or informed earlier.] =",terrible,terrible,bad
