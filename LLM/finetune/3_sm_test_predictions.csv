[pros: It is a job.
There is a health plan. (Very costly)
There is an excellent health plan if you work at one of the unionized locations.
You will get paid. (However there were times when your mileage reimbursements would be a couple of weeks late)
Above average time off.
cons: I am a former employee, have written review in the past. With 9yrs of employment here behind me, seeing what I’ve seen, experienced what I have experienced, talk with & witnessed daily operations of other branches within our district, I can say without reservation that the positive depiction of Stericycle that is portrayed by the reviews posted here does not exist. I am not questioning not doubting Glassdoor’s authentication practices, but the environment described is not real. Possibly somewhere in the country there is, i don’t know, but not here.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: During my tenure I had the opportunity to meet and collaborate with a handful of intelligent, reliable, high performing, and genuinely caring colleagues. We tackled some interesting client dilemmas and started to build viable solutions to meet client aspirations, and beyond.
cons: Great colleagues and interesting client work were few and far between. People/Culture: As mentioned in other reviews, the company is littered with legacy Solstice employees who propagate a fraternity/sorority atmosphere which seems to work for those select cliques, but not for the truly talented, under-utilized, misaligned staff. Company and team dynamics would be described as cringe-worthy. Example 1: On several occasions, the practice lead and other senior members were made aware that the project roles did not align with client’s needs and project direction. I was told to keep the status quo because there was no other billable work in the company and to find ways to justify ourselves. Granted, consultants trying to “justify” their work to clients is not new, but this response by leadership went against my moral compass. Example 2: On another occasion, I made clear to client leads, practice leads and HR that the team atmosphere was unhealthy and dysfunctional (teammates using berating language and behavior which created an atmosphere of working in fear) and ultimately triggering to me, a survivor of emotional abuse. I clearly wanted to roll off and was told to hang on despite the deterioration of my emotional state. Despite several attempts to work through communication and work style differences, I was told to keep at it by leadership and that they essentially were not willing to step in. It was clear then: “leadership” favored revenue and high performing, toxic individuals above the hard work, dedication and mental health of truly talented staff. Work: What I assume are growing pains from acquisitions, the company works in silos. Example 1: Client engagements are sold and scoped by uninformed, unqualified client engagement leads, which led to systemic project issues that could not be rectified down the line because of the original terms of the agreement. Example 2: Practices had no clue the breadth of skills in the organization as a whole; most of the time personnel from the strategy practice are looked to drive engagements (because they are legacy and bark the loudest), however they've no clue as to how to move a project from concepts to delivery. The company had no appreciation or understanding for UX and Creative Design, let alone know how to staff and run a team that required these workstreams. Also, never in my career have I ever worked with a client who pulled the parachute and stopped a project mid stream; this happened not once, but twice, in my short stint. The company is so mired in set ways of working and meeting utilization rates for bonuses, that they can’t move fast enough to get to MVPs and really cement relationships with clients. Leadership: Most of those in leadership positions have been on maybe 1 or 2 client engagements in their entire tenure and are legacy Solstice resources. They are unqualified at the positions they have been lucky to land at and apparently are the ones trying to right their currently sinking ship. Not surprised at all by the recent layoffs (or the terrible way it was communicated and handled). The first red flag was in November 2022 when the company had an all-hands meeting about when and how to put colleagues on PIPs; this essentially was the first wave of layoffs (without having to say it was a layoff). Good luck trying to bounce back the business and culture once trust was lost due to mismanaged layoffs, an RTO push contradictory to company values from just one year ago and client relationships fraught with unmet promises and sub par work.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: Good community
Managers are understanding (to an extent)
You have freedom in terms of availability and full control of your work

[pros: Relatively good pay. Mostly very collegial approach in communication with other functions. Safety is taken rather seriously.
cons: Global sourcing team is ruled at pure dictatorshiplike basis. No critical thinking will be tolerated, intimidation is the only management tactics known. To be promoted/ thought of by the leadership team you need to be white US based male  between 30 and 50, preferably a gun freak, as shooting will be a part of the so called team events. Diversity? Wrong message here...

Prior to COVID19 no home office possible.
 
All talks on creativity, thinking out of the box and strategic supplier relationships always end in a ""go get asap savings, no matter what"" just a month or two later.  Literally the same situation every single second half of the year for the last 7 years.

[pros: Morningstar rewards those that make an impact and provides feedback on what you can do to improve. There has been a significant shift to be more client centric which ultimately will prove to be the right solution long term, with greater unity across the teams within the company.

[pros: Every now and then they give free games out to store leaders. It's up to the store leader if they want to share them with other associates. In years past store leaders would also receive free consoles. 

15% employee discount on everything except new video game consoles, gift cards, POSA cards, and digital codes/currency. 

""First dibs"" on high in demand items like new video game consoles, collector's editions of games, etc. This is also subject to store manager approval.

Full time benefits include paid time off, paid sick leave, and medical insurance. 

Assistant Store Leaders are practically guaranteed at least 30-32 hours weekly. Some store managers will be willing to schedule you 40 hours if the store has enough payroll hours.

The company has zero tolerance for any form of abuse or discrimination. This refers to both employees and customers.
cons: There is no job security. If you do not meet sales expectations at least 2-3 weeks in a row you can expect at best a write-up from the store leader or district manager. The company treats everyone like they are expendable and won't hesitate to fire people for performance or some ridiculous circumstances. 

There are no annual raises. Some people from other stores in my area have worked for the company 20+ years and still receive the exact same pay they did back then when they first started working with the company. 

The pay is ridiculous. At the time I was promoted to Assistant Store Leader I only received $11/hour.

Some stores are understaffed and will work managers to the bone. In regards to the store I worked at, we lost our store manager back in November so me and one of the Senior Guest Advisors worked 40+ hours every week to ensure the store stayed open. This left me physically and mentally exhausted. I basically assumed the position of store leader without receiving the store leader's benefits. 

Managers can expect to work single coverage every day except some weekends.

The training process isn't very effective. The company provides 15 payroll hours for training. This mostly consists of completing a training module that has employees review the employee handbook plus basic work practices and answer simple questions. After that is finished there is barely any time for real-time experience. In a senior guest advisor/assistant store manager's case this would also include management training on top of basic training with the same amount of payroll hours allotted.] =",terrible,neutral,none

[pros: I have a worked with the company for almost 5 years. I started off as an account manager where I was amazed by how much money I was able to make as well as all the incentives that were offered. One thing that is great about Logonation is they are very detailed from day one about your job description and each employee knows exactly what is expected of them which is wonderful. I have had an opportunity to advance with the company and since I have been here it has been nothing but a wonderful experience. Working for a company like Logonation you are not just another number you actually matter, and they do a great job at every level of showing that to all of their employees. From a sales rep now to manager I feel Logonation does a wonderful job at training their employees, as well as, always providing help for those who need it.  Overall it has been exciting to grow with Logonation, and be a part of a company who has continually made the Inc 500o list as one of the fastest growing companies in America.

cons: Don't practice what they preach. Don't train new Boeing employees, politics are extremely evident here, and it's not who you know but who you blow. They love butt kissers, yes-men, knee pad wearers, and suck-ups. Old employees with 20 or more years think their stuff doesn't stink and can do no wrong; don't like change and feel threatened by new hires that have more real world experience than they do. If you don't play by their rules of ""it's always been this way"" then you get black listed and don't stand a chance of going anywhere. Management Top Heavy, I mean really? Level 1-5 managers needed? Plus supervisors and leads? Boeing has way too many employees and not enough work. Lots of employees stand around and talk all day and gossip. Actual work takes less time than documented. Employees who've been there a while abuse the overtime system and bilk Boeing out of Millions each year. Unions don't work for the employee anymore, it's all about money and bribes. Each year more and more benefits get taken away cuz stupid unions won't work with Boeing to keep jobs here. No wonder they have shipped jobs out overseas. I would too if my employees were greedy, whiny babies. Old technology used to do jobs and alot of complaining by employees to improve things, but no one does anything to fix it, and those that try get knocked down. Teamwork not encouraged, no true open door policies, no training, no work instructions that actually describe how to do the jobs in detail, too much tribal knowledge so when people retire, so does their knowledge of how to do the job. Too much power tripping and control freaks there. Demoralize people all the time. Worst Company to work for. I could go on and on.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: I have been working at this office for nearly 4 years and a major reason I remain happily employed here is because of the positive work atmosphere. It is a smaller office, so management encourages a friendly, team-oriented work environment, where everyone pitches in and helps out. I find this to be a breath of fresh air compared to some of the bigger places I’ve worked at. Management also encourages communication and monthly meetings are held where employees are welcome to offer suggestions and raise issues if they see any. This is something that was never available in my previous jobs. The nature of this industry creates high stress situations at times. That’s why a one quality that I respect most management is that when mistakes are made (because we’re only human) the policy is not to blame or chastise but instead, the focus is on how to remedy the error and move forward. This speaks volumes in my book. Quality work is appreciated here and does not go unnoticed like it does in some bigger firms. The pay and the hours are good, and vacation/personal time is very flexible. I have never had an issue with it in my 4 years here.
cons: No major cons.  As long as you’re willing to communicate with management, this is a great place to work.] =",good,excellent,excellent

[pros: Great benefits.  The company is known for offering great benefits.  When I first started in 2013, the company used to match the entire percentage of 401k now they only match the first 5%, which is good too.  HR used to be great to employees now, everyone is just trying to abide by rules and trying to maintain their jobs, rather than trying to investigate allegations made by employees.
cons: Lack of structure after Victor Luis and Stuart Vevers took over.  The company went a direction where we, as employees feel like they were lying and hiding reports from us.  Giving celebrities free things aren't generating profits for the company.  The numbers doesn't match.  As employees, we can't disagree with upper management.  If you do, you will be wearing a scarlet letter as someone who do NOT follow orders.  The image of Coach has changed...for the worst.  They're no LONGER the ALL AMERICAN company.  They're trying to compete with luxurious companies when Coach should have stayed as the middle class, affordable company they're known for.  Those who can afford a $798 handbags will not be spending it at COACH, which is why the company isn't where it used to be as far as profit.  The numbers just doesn't add up.] =",bad,terrible,bad

cons: I don't know where to begin. The two words to best describe my experience at Allen Tate would we overworked and underpaid. Poor management, favoritism, micromanagement. The agents are the most important people to ALL management and leadership, meaning unless you're an agent you are at the absolutely very bottom of their list. They do not offer any 401k matching at all. You will only be recognized if you make a mistake. Also, any mistake, no matter how small, will be blow up to make you seem terrible and incompetent.

[pros: Amazing Culture!! Very friendly, welcoming, and supportive!! Excellent benefits! Salaries that are displayed on some of the employment websites are below what they actually pay. They are competitive and place a strong emphasis on retaining excellent employees!  

Not only customer centered, but also a focus on training and retaining good employees. They value employee's opinions and have a specific program designed especially to encourage employees to share innovative ideas to help improve all areas of the company. 

The company is growing and changing rapidly. Opportunities to advance and grow into other areas of interest are frequently mentioned. There are many employees who have been there for 10+ years, most starting out in an entry level position. All speak very highly of the company, and are clearly proud to be long time employees. The company also embraces diversity and actively engage in programs designed to help local communities. 

I have only been there a couple months, but am incredibly impressed with what I have experienced so far! I was leery about changing to this career field at first, but I am so grateful that I made the jump. Many of the entry level jobs I had been looking at were clearly focused on hiring kids right out of college. This company is committed to hiring those whom they feel will benefit The Hartford, regardless of age.
cons: There is a lot of new information that comes to you all at once when starting out. It's pretty overwhelming. (But there is a lot of support from other team members.)

[pros: Will pay for you to become a certified gemologist and diamondtologist IF you meet their qualifications, after a set amount of time with the company.
cons: Employee discount is not that great. Their training and business policy in a nutshell is to ""emotionally blackmail"", badger and harass customers into products and services they do not want or are out of the price range the customers have said they're comfortable with. You are belittled if you get a sale that is not an amount they want. Imo, any sale is better than no sale; I saw many customers walk out the door because they felt overly pressured by other associates and/or store management.

[pros: You can request time off/days off season permiting. You have a set schedule.
cons: Customers screaming at you all day, trying their best to get a discount or return items that is so old you cannot find it in the system. In addition, there is no room for advancement. Once you start where you are at, they will try their best to keep you especially if you are doing well. You may go on a ""loan"" but it will be reversed as soon as there is a sale or busy season. Treat you like a machine not a human and they try and find different ways not to give bonus. Every employee I spoke to needed a paycheck. Its literally the worst job ever! If you need a paycheck, great stay but get out as soon as you can. 
The managers are incompetent and usually do not have time to fix issues you may have even if it involves customers, they try to pass the buck as much as possible. The system is so slow and you have to try and work around the fact that impatient customers are waiting for your computer to load. I could go for hours but basically for this  position I would not recommend to my worst enemy because it is draining and demanding. I felt exhausted every day because of the negativity.  Managers would give you specific policies and would go back on their word, as long as the customer gets nasty enough making you look like a liar.

[pros: Plenty of good people all around the office Good salary for Malaga Good career opportunities and good exposure to specific industry technologies
cons: Office location is bad (PTA), nothing to do around the office for afterwork and hardly anywhere to eat without driving. Not enough parking spaces. The news ones are a good 5 mn walk from the office (ridiculous!) Going back to the office is nice in a way, but not enough privacy rooms and meeting rooms in general (not a lof of brain put into the new way of working implementation) Within a 6 months gap, encouraging your staff to work remotely and then 6 months later telling them to go back to the office 3 days a week and if you don't like it you can go away. More than 20% of the Malaga staff resigned because of that + few fired for shady reasons.. What kind of brain has our leadership team? No communication regarding if the company is making money or not. No bonus of course... A joke of a strategy and vision from our leadership team with constant internal rebranding for no reason which most employees do not understand anymore. No communication in terms of where the business is going (again, no vision/strategy) When your main customer and the company founders are just a bunch of friends then you understand that whatever happens, your main customer will never leave therefore no pressure on the leadership team to change anything. Typical shady umbrella business/companies. Most employees are aware of that btw. The leadership team is a nice bunch at individual level but as a group they are quite mediocre as we can see how they handled the new way of working.] =",terrible,bad,bad

[pros: - Good experience to have on resume with many well know titles
- Good benefits and employee plan options for short term gain
- Free games and discounts on games
- Some good people that exist in the company
- Lots of challenges that may stimulate some people
cons: The longterm downsides are many:
- No work life balance, very long work hours. If you do try to have one, or talk to HR about it, management will stab you in the back and either lay you off or find a way to fire you. 
- Major micro-management with no end in site.
- Very poor tools and pipelines
- Major politics. Yes, it exists in many work places but EA is beyond bad. How they ever received a ""Great place for families to work"" is beyond me. Lots of backstabbing and lies by the many clicks that run the roost.
- Dishonest management and HR. Will smile at your face while working on getting rid of you in the background
- No chance for long term career development or raises unless you're in the click.
- Long hours with no end in site now that this company is sinking like a stone.
- Management is so bad I don't know where to start.
- Upper management does not care about it's employees long term goals or future, only their personal gains.
- Don't bother going to HR about anything, it will only put a bullseye on you.
- You will start out strong and, like most, will burnout within a few years due to the Darwinian mentality that is so pervasive. Not healthy for a creative environment.
- If you're married plan on a future divorce.
- Super high attrition rate. Most people that start there will be gone by choice, layoff, or firing within 4 years.

For the very short term it's an ok place to work and get some experience.
But don't plan on a career there. If you go in, get out before you burnout.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

Human Resources also shares private information with supervisors, who then use that information against employees. Hands down the worst company I've ever worked for.

[pros: I am so proud to be a part of Cracker Barrel.  I've worked here for 25 years and it's gone by so fast.  We have such a unique culture, and the quality of the individuals that work here both in the field and Home Office is amazing.  It's great to be a part of such a well respected brand and to see new stores year after year!  I've witnessed over 500 stores open since I've joined and I have been truly blessed to be a part of this company. Our next venture ""Holler and Dash Biscuit House"" is just the icing on the cake!
cons: To continue the kind of growth and success we've experienced thus far is not easy.  As long as we continue to hold our mission statement of ""pleasing people"" at the forefront, I believe we can look forward another 25+ years of being America's best family dining brand!] =",excellent,excellent,good

[pros: I get a paycheck every two weeks. I mostly get left alone due to mismanagement.
cons: Employment here seems to be on a decline. Every week I am overhearing a conversation about someone else leaving the company. Main reason usually due to mismanagement. Outdated machines, outdated software, hostile work environment some places, and there seems to be an issue to get simple things approved. I recently had an issue with budget approval for my department. Resulting in a third party repair service to deny repairs and parts due to lack of payment. Same for software licenses.

[pros: Some very talented people, but many have left or have one foot out the door.

CEO has a pretty good vision of what the company can be, but has completely lost control of EMEA.
cons: A seismic shift occurred early in 2019 when they replaced the CEO. The current CEO, Kevin Jones has a vision for the company, and I think it's pretty sound.

BUT... and here's the big BUT... he's totally lost control of EMEA. While the CEO has focused on North America during the pandemic (and done a pretty good job), he's ousted almost the entire EMEA leadership team. 

It's fair enough that he thought some changes needed to be made.

But the new team consists of the fossilised former middle managers of IBM's consulting business. And their big plan for Rackspace EMEA is to turn it into a mirror image of what IBM was 20 years ago.

Everyone understands that Rackspace's future is in professional services. But Rackspace doesn't have a vision for what PS can look like in 2021. There's no grand plan for disrupting the market. It's just ""look over there and copy whatever they're doing, we want some of that"".

Be very wary of joining the professional services practice. During the interview process, you need to ask deep questions about what you'll actually be doing. Don't allow deflection with vague answers and promises of blue skies. You need to ask for specifics, and keep asking. Then ask some more.

If not super-careful, experienced professional services practitioners could very well find themselves in a bog-standard support role under the guise of professional services. And you'll be dealing with some very unhappy and increasingly vocal customers.] =",terrible,bad,excellent

[pros: Staples is collaborative and inclusive, and the leadership is encouraged to develop their associate and promote from within. Your opinion actually matters at Staples. Benefits are offered and there are many programs to get involved with to either earn money toward your own health benefits or reimbursements for gym memberships and equipment.
cons: One of the few cons that comes to the forefront of my mind is compensation - I have worked for Staples for almost 20 years and I have held various positions and although I do love the company the pay when you are promoted from within is scant compared to being hired as an external a mere 5% for promotions and about a 1.5% increase annually. Also part of compensation is vacation time - if you are hired as an exempt associate you receive 2 weeks vacation after your first year - three after 6 and then 4 weeks after 10 years, then it takes another 10 years before you reach that 5 week mark. Other employers are giving 3 weeks right at day one and the weeks add faster. Reporting to Wall Street is tough, Staples is a very frugal company and we are often restricted from traveling  - this makes it challenging to manage my remote people.] =",excellent,good,bad

Day-to-day work is great because everyone is smart, organized, thoughtful and kind. It can get busy, but most companies are ""fast paced"" so that's not a weird thing. 
Now that I've started working in the office, I enjoy it even more. The office is beautiful and the views from the 27th floor of the Prudential Tower are stunning. The kitchen is a great perk, too, because it's filled with snacks and coffee!

Very positive and safe environment for demographically diverse workforce, and takes seriously respect and sexual harassment awareness.  Customers in many solution areas are beginning to see improved product, good cadence with product releases and functionality.
cons: Some employees can be protective of knowledge and that throttles coaching and knowledge sharing to an extent. Pockets of employees still immature,selfish, and lacking in self-awareness- take advantage of loose policies governing flexible workplace, vacation, sick time. Senior level leadership has good intentions but the execution is shackled by short term needs of shareholders and Wall St. CA has globally distributed product development teams, but some locations are deemed better than others for innovation and product development- results in layoffs and lack of investment in some locations, while others - especially off shore and West coast - receive more attention.  There is such a thing as working out of a loser office.  We need to turn the corner at ""where old products go to die"" and where acquisition products get wrung out and hung to die. Much of leadership is hired from other established tech companies and asked to ""do here what you did there"", which ends up being rutted policy and procedure instead of allowing innovative and organic talent development.] =",good,bad,excellent

- wide ranging and always changing work flow. The company is constantly evolving and often is engaged in unique projects for clients that provide great learning opportunities for anyone involved in them.

- good work ethic/product is well recognized, partly due to the size of the teams.

cons: Payed too little for way to much work. Half the time you will be doing everybodys job while your job starts to pile up. 
They dont care much about there employees and worry way to much about credit apps. 
You learn after a couple days or on the first day that a bunch of people are not happy and are there just to make ends meet. 
Hours never stay the same and usually you don't know what your work schedule is going to be till the last minute, then you show up late and get frowned up on. 
Some Sales associates are Sharks, they will do whatever they can to steel a sale in a heartbeat. 
Everybody is out to get one another. Team Work does not apply to this work environment. 
Managers do a whole lot of talking but not enough actual work. 
The Actual store manager sits in his office and walks around on occasion just to make an appearance. Whats the point of having a morning meeting everyday if your going to say the same thing all the time. 
When a manager is not present, usually one of the other employees who has been around a a bit longer tries to pull rank by telling everyone what to do.

cons: -Discount is limited to $500 per season
-Discount is added up from Original Price, not discounted price
-Discount Can only be used in your Aldo 'home' store
-Cannot order online with your discount, so whatever shoes are in your home store you're stuck with that. If they don't have your size... oh well.

-There are sales goals, shoe care, handbags, and orders you HAVE to meet.

[pros: Booz Allen has done a smart job of documenting and structuring the firm. The way the business side is run can be very personality driven as each partner controls their own business. But the people side is pretty good (though personalities obviously vary by team). HR is responsive, collaboration is understood as a key to good business, management is generally willing to be transparent and communicative. Professional advancement is encouraged and cultivated.
cons: Professional advancement is not always encouraged and cultivated with the employees broader goals in mind. You have to be very pro-active in knowing what you want and vocalizing that. Otherwise they are going to look at the experience you have and put you where it works for the business, not for you. The culture is on the conservative side, most people still wear at least a tie, many a suit. That shouldn't be a surprise, it's a client facing business that deals with the government and the military so they are inclined to present a particular image.] =",neutral,good,bad

[pros: Liberty is just over 100 years old and steadfast in modernizing its practices. Over the last several years, Liberty has strived for a lean-like operation, going as far as branding its own management system; however, to date, it has only penetrated the facade of the business.

Being a large company, it has wide footprints - mostly in the midwest and east coast, offering a range of opportunities to those that live in, or desire to move to those areas. Salaries are average.
cons: Restructuring is a common practice, often displacing very talented people and creating very tall, bureaucratic configuration within the many SBUs.

Learning opportunities can be frequent, but are often limited to the narrow track of business in a particular unit. 

Frontline management is primarily comprised of promoted technicians, giving rise to an ever increasing gap in fundamental managerial practices. Middle management seems to be caught between doing the right thing and heeding to the demands of the executives, often making promises they cannot keep and losing key personnel.

Work/life balance has been a popular thought over the last few years, but it seemingly has only been achieved with lower pay grades within certain SBUs.

While salaries are average, they are much lower than younger companies across different industries. Health benefits appear appropriate to such a large and mature company - limited and costly.

The culture appears to be driven by the home office in Boston, with many of the regional offices carrying resentment for this aspect. Once pseudo-independent, regional offices prided themselves in making regional decisions, even if it was only on the surface. Restructuring and centralization has caused an increasing rift within Liberty. Employees are given and annual survey, seeking honest opinions about management, operations and pride in the company. While scores, as well as participation rates have increased over the years, so has interdepartmental competition, coaxing participation and offering rewards to those offices/departments that carry higher rates of participation.] =",bad,bad,none

They are incredibly disorganized with scheduling and are constantly having problems with parents. Very unprofessional and incompetent management. Their curriculum is also terrible, old, and full of mistakes. Honestly, unless you can't find students on your own, don't bother with this company.

It also leaves staff feeling like their voice doesn’t matter or their daily struggles are not important or worth resolving. It’s not the middle management’s fault, it’s the administration above them that could enact the change needed, but they’re failing to acknowledge that there is an issue.

I did not get a chance to see my office or get a good feel of what the day to day activities would be like. Had I seen those things, I probably would not have taken the position.

cons: No support from upper management what so ever!!!  The only good thing about working at Quest is the benefits, but don’t work over your 40 hours.  You will not get paid out your time.  If you have an issue do not expect anyone to help you, the management don’t care about their employees or what they are going through, as long as your there for your scheduled shift.  They have obvious favorites and if you have been here for 14 years or more and still haven’t moved up don’t expect one anytime soon.  This place is a joke and just another paycheck.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: At least it is a job.
cons: It’s most definitely a “good ol’ boys club”. Upper management does nothing to make positive changes. You are highly overworked and underpaid/unappreciated. Upper management wants everyone to meet expectations for a workload that’s for 3 people then complains when numbers aren’t met. Yet they conveniently can’t find the funds for new hires all the while there’s always a a position that’s created for some unqualified person to be the manager or director of something. There’s absolutely no room for growth unless you like waiting 4+ years for a title change.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

I have seen people having more than 15 years in BMC and have a great growth too. 
Everything is great in BMC. just go for it if you are getting a good offer. I am with BMC for the last 7 years and I thought I will be in BMC for a max of 2 years :).
cons: You will surely hear about layoffs in BMC but it's not actually true. First of all layoff is part of IT and every company does that so not new with BMC but the main thing is in my 7 years of career, I have never seen any good performer fired from the job. NEVER. All who are replaced or fired are just in their comfort zone, not growing, not learning, bad attitude etc. so please please focus on learning then you will never face this issue.

- If you get fired as well then layoff perks are great too so its not that bad... LOL] =",excellent,excellent,good

[pros: The only thing good I can say about MSX International is that it was the way that I was able to return to Ford Motor Company, as contracted employee, after my direct job had been ""eliminated"", in January, 2009, with one more year of employment to be eligible for retirement.
cons: The pay was 22% less that what I used to make, even though I was working with and interacting with the same people, in the same location where I worked for 9 years.

I was only provided 5 holidays a year and no sick/personal or vacation days.  You either came in to work or you received no pay.  Pretty tough way to work. 
After being unemployed for 16 months, I had to have my neighbors take my wife for an important MRI, because I needed to make the pay for that day.

No short term disability, health coverage that was a joke even though it cost over $200 a month...that is for $2,500 deductible and $5,400 out of pocket cost, and anything that I had priror to MSX employment was disqualified from coverage.

Makes one wonder if it would have been better to continue to struggle with unemployment and TAA benefits and wait for a better opportunity.  However, after being out for so long, one will take this type of job, because of financial situations.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: Good retirement through Railroad Retirement Board. Medical benefits are still decent so far. The work itself is not all that difficult after you learn it.
cons: No schedule whatsoever, just on-call 24/7/365. Predicting when you will get called to work is extremely difficult due to inaccurate train lineups. Planning even the simplest of events with family is nearly impossible. Draconian attendance policy does not allow for sufficient time off without facing discipline. You spend most of the time due to irregular sleep patterns, and often have to sacrifice sleep time to get basic household chores done or share a meal with your family for the first time all week. Often you spend over 24 hours in a hotel away from home, which resets your consecutive days worked under the Federal Rest law, which prevents you from earning 48 hours off at home, so now they can make you work even more without seeing your family. Upper management is totally out of touch with their workforce and the work they do; they preach safety and caring, but only act upon maximizing profits for themselves and shareholders with no regard to how it actually impacts the people doing the work that brings in their record profits. Then they task lower management with handing down discipline to employees who make even the slightest petty infringement on rule compliance. We must follow all rules at all times, but management is free to bend and break rules whenever it suits their convenience with nothing more than signing their initials to it. Even though this job is union protected, the union has little power against the company. Federal law prohibits the unions from striking except under certain circumstances. Even when those circumstances are met, strikes are pretty much always blocked by the government. With billions of dollars in profit every quarter, the company can buy any politician or government official they need to get their greedy way.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Zayo has the best culture of any company I have worked for. My coworkers are brilliant, energetic, and helpful. Every day I need to be ready / able to wear a different hat to satisfy the needs of my team. Not a day goes by that I don't learn something new. Their startup approach to business will force you to put in many many hours of work. However, throwing yourself head first into your projects will help you grow substantially. If you can put in the effort that is required to get the job done.
cons: Raises are few and far between from what I have seen. Cost of living goes up every year and child care is very expensive (increasing annually as well).

[pros: Principal does have a good benefits package (although that might not be as strong of an offering in the future).

Different perspectives are not supported here and will be squelched by those who will use ""company culture"" to their defense and detriment ( why you will often here ""that's the way we've always done it"").

Principal employees know that the company heavily favors external talent compared to internal talent which is why you see employees leave for a competitor for a year or two just to come back (obtain larger salary jumps compared to had they stayed at principal).

[pros: I get a GREAT end of year bonus, and 2 extra weeks a year off usually for the 4th of July and Christmas.

Technicians with broader skills and styles are leaving because of the incompatibility with the management and no chance of promotion. Look at some of the GREAT leaders that have stepped down. NO DEPARTMENT SENIORITY. How can you bring someone from production with ZERO maintenance experience through an apprenticeship and then in 3 years give them access to 1st shift while you have higher skilled workers with 15 plus years in maintenance forced to stay on 2nd or 3rd. Rules prevent SHIFT TO SHIFT in a transfer to another area unless you have been at the same job post for 10 years. So you quit instead of finding happiness in another building possibly.

They do an extensive several week training for my position with a group of others that is like being in a school classroom with an instructor.  They do really try hard to make sure you're prepared before they set you free.  They also have good benefits and discounts.
cons: They have too many rules and phone measurements to make. If you needed to use the restroom that counted against your required time you have to be on the phone.

[pros: Flexible work hours, ""unlimited"" vacation, opportunities to travel. Relatively secure industry.
cons: GE Transportation used to be a great company to work for. I've been with the company for 10 years now. The pay was great, the benefits were great, work-life balance was good. The company took care of you, especially if you were an engineer.

Ever since the merger with Wabtec, all that has seem to gone out the door. Partially, this can be attributed to COVID, but this was still a problem before then. All contractors have been laid off, numerous engineer roles on my team alone were not backfilled after people retired/left. The workload, however, has increased. Work-life balance has gone down the drain, 50-60 hour weeks are the norm now. We used to at least get a medal and a pat on the back for service anniversaries - I just hit 10 years last month and got nada. 

The company is bloated with do-nothing, overpaid program managers who set unrealistic deadlines and expectations to the customer. Input from engineers is seemingly ignored when it comes to timeline estimates for projects.

Pay is below average in an area where there are plenty of defense contractors and aerospace companies who offer much better pay and better hours for engineers. Because of this, a lot of talented engineers have left over the past few years for better opportunities right down the road and a lot of valuable knowledge has gone out the door. 

The profit margin on a lot of these software products is great yet somehow the company has no money to invest back into it's talent.] =",bad,terrible,excellent

[pros: When I first started I really liked my coworkers, the perks were nice and training was long but felt prepared. Managers were nice and trainers were great, building was a bit old (you couldn’t get a hot meal, everything was microwaves and vending machines) but within a year they opened a cafeteria and expanded the building. 
Vendor fair was great, twice a year they did a fair with all of the partner hotels and you got goodies and could win free hotel stays or perks. 
They always gave you a free Turkey in thanksgiving, you got a free thanksgiving meal and a free meal in your birthday month. 
You got the universal perks but got to work in an air conditioned building far from the parks.
We got special goodies when there was an opening for a new park or new hotel: tumblers, bags, towels, etc.
cons: This list is LONG:
- Management in this place is TOXIC, I personally saw supervisors lie about what happened to get employees reprimanded. Saw supervisors arrived to the call center drunk because they would disappear for 3 hours (hours they were supposed to be working, of course) and they would harass employees while drunk. Saw supervisors sexually harass female and male co-workers, send inappropriate photos via social media and even excuse the fact that some employees were manipulating commissions and basically stealing just because they liked that employee. 
- Upper management will always turn a blind eye to the supervisors behavior, and even defend their supervisors to the point that if you ever went to HR that complaint was not acknowledged, your only option was to go to HR at the parks and if did that, there was going to be consequences for “jumping the chain of command”. 
- They would ask you to work overtime and if you couldn’t, they would try to reprimand the entire call center saying “people needs to help of we will have to start doing mandatory overtime”. 
- There was employees having sex on the parking lot with supervisors. 
- The department was made to work every single holiday and some until 10PM, 11PM on New Year’s Eve so good luck receiving the new year on the I-4. 
- If a department had a lot of employees making high commission, they would find ways to modify the commission percentages to lower the payout numbers. 
- Pay raises are a joke, you can have outstanding performance and get a 70 cent raise a year, salary is also very low compared to a lot of other places. 
- You are expected to take 5 different queues of calls but every queue has a particular commission “bucket” so you could sell a lot in all queues but if you don’t go over the “bucket” you got nothing for either.
- QA is a joke, they say you don’t need a script but the QA forms is several pages long and their employees score incorrectly a lot. 
- Growth is almost nonexistent.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

[pros: This job does allow for people with great experience and knowledge in the music industry to be able to help people on their own musical journey. The one to one relationship with customers can be very rewarding and fulfilling. The great discount and finger on the pulse of the music industry is exciting and getting to hear or demo new products before they are announced is cool. Tight knit work environment with your coworkers and most other sales engineers are helpful. Even if you don't know the answer to someone's question, there is a person in the company that definitely will.

You set your own goals and are encouraged to meet them. Coaches and managers help find the best balance to make sure your goals are attainable based on your previous performance.
cons: Straight commissioned sales means that you eat what you kill. Works great for people that thrive in that environment, but not everyone does. The hours can be a little rough especially when you're first starting out. Mandatory meetings are nice to keep on top of the industry, but can really get old.] =",good,good,excellent

[pros: Work life balance
Career path of technologists. No IT companies in India have growth path for technologist after certain level. In IBM equal opportunity provided for technologists compared to managers
cons: Pathetic Indian top management. Most of them are in Retiring age and they don't give a damn about company or its employees. They are more worried about their salary and benefits. In a nutshell they just want to survive in the organization 
  IBM is a technical company and  managers are clueless of technology. Imagine how effective can they be. Managers pride themselves on not being technical and will run away from any opportunity to do anything close to technical
  Top management adept at working in Excel and nothing much else. They don't have any clue about strategy, Business, technology any skill which is required for Software technology company
  They offer bonus (Bogus bonus) in compensation. Despite being a top rater you hardly get 15 percent of it
  Focus is more on utilization than the placing right skills  at right places.

- Very little sense of formal training, hit the ground running and pick it up fast.

[pros: Great company mission and vision. The Patients First culture is great to see from the top down. Each summer they have a patient summit which highlights the patients and people who have touched that particular pump. 
For the most part everyone is really approachable when you are the new person. Depending on the team there is great communication and dependability.
cons: Certain departments clearly get more shine than others. It’s evident in the “town hall” meetings. Manufacturing and Quality Engineering seem to be left out of most congratulatory events and recognitions. 
Some managers are under qualified for their roles and it shows. Their teams suffer do to mismanagement, untrustworthiness and lack of engagement. 
There is a family style culture...but not in a good way. If you’re  closer to someone at the top,  you’re guaranteed an opportunity. Others are left at the bottom hoping for recognition for their long hours and hard work. 
Turnover..turnover...turnover. In a span of 3-6 months, the Quality department has vanished do to lack of job satisfaction. Managers are not taking engineers seriously during there 1:1 meetings. 
Be very careful what you communicate to Human Resources, at the end of the day they are looking out the better of the business and top management..not you unfortunately.
Diversity. There is none at the management level. With these times of racial inequity, Abiomed needs to take a hard look at who are they promoting (that is qualified of course) and who they are hiring. Once you get up to C-level forget about it. You won’t see much diversity..sad to say it.] =",neutral,bad,excellent

[pros: Work life balance, speak up culture, compensation, opportunities, the list goes on. I have enjoyed my time here at Smith. I started as a Contractor for a Development Engineering position. The next year I was promoted to DEII, then I sought after a Project Manager position and my career has just skyrocketed with the amount of learning I have been exposed to. The social atmosphere is very relaxed and friendly.
cons: I honestly have no Cons. I had issues with a higher level manager (she was not my direct manager) at one time but she was the only issue I had and ya know, they can't all be great all the time. Never received an official apology from that person who basically berated me but that is ok. I won't hold that individual against Smith altogether. She did magically seem to transfer to another department altogether, which I was glad for so I would no longer have to deal with that kind of unfriendliness. I honestly cried on the meeting while she yelled out me, so hopefully I will never have to deal with her again.] =",good,excellent,excellent

[pros: Flexible work arrangements including telecommuting options.
cons: The culture does not inspire morale nor loyalty. Example, the performance evaluation program (determines next year's pay increases and bonuses) would be comparable to gladiators in a ring. Whoever is left standing is the victor.  Those who are perceived to have the most value are rewarded according to a differentiation scale which managers/directors have to battle it out in a differentiation meeting. Example 25% of employees will be received high rating, 50% receive average, and 25% receive low rating.  Employees could be rated in the lowest 5-10% performance category even though they met all their performance goals and objectives because there is a limited number of positions available to fit in the higher categories.  

The company conducts annual employee surveys where the employees give their opinion and feed back on management, their perception of the company, how they feel about their work environment etc.  The final overall company rating is linked to employee compensation.  Basically, if employees give a 75% rating then they get 75% of the target bonus. If the rating is 25%, then they get 25% of their target bonus. The better rating you give, the more of the target bonus is given. The worse the rating, the less the target bonus is given. 

Unprofessional behavior by some managers and directors such as belittling and yelling at their subordinates in front of other colleagues is looked over. This is largely due that there is no longer a visible HR presence. In past years, HR was a building away. Now, you have to call a toll free number to reach a benefit service center to discuss HR matters.  The other pathway is to express your concerns about your management thru 360 feedback on your management.  It does not appear to lead to resolution but only more resentment/passive aggressive retaliation when the manager or director reads the feedback.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

The company is mostly a java shop but there are pockets of activity in other languages, and management seems very open to suggestions. There are lots of opportunities to learn and try new things.
cons: I don't have admin rights to my own workstation, which is a first for me. I think Orbitz is suffering from some poor technical decisions made in the past.  There needs to be a bigger focus on teams sharing a common framework for software development. Instead of fixing the standard framework, some teams will simply strike off on their own using different versions of java or creating non-standard build steps to meet their needs.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

cons: Your work schedule, though flexible, is set for anywhere from a 3-6 month period. The pay is excellent but the environment can be very stressful.

[pros: People were great; both coworkers and direct managers were supportive and friendly, and just generally good people. Appreciated a job well done, made coming to work each day a pleasant experience.

When I started,
cons: Starting salary was good, but ""merit"" raises (typically just 2% COLA) were a joke. Benefits were extremely lackluster for a Fortune 500, and 401(k) matching is a joke (just 1%).

Upper management is a revolving door of stale ideas and failure, perennially forced out and then replaced with another member of the old guard who insists on putting their friends in high-level positions and then making the same mistakes.] =",bad,terrible,excellent

[pros: Flexible schedule, nice coworkers, nice management, better than WalMart. Whenever I needed time off, typically it was given to me.

For entrepreneur minded individuals, this is a great place to start a career to learn and develop skills in sales, customer service, operations and traffic management, and leadership potential.
cons: There are still many areas for improvement that are often associated with a young company looking to grow rapidly.

[pros: Super great work environment. Honestly, everyone is hardworking and willing to help. My manager is super cool and he is very much considerate and 100% willing to help for my learnings and developments (Shoutout to him). There are a lot of resources available to improve as well. And one thing that made signed for this job is that the benefits are great. Hours are great too but so far we have been remote since my day one. Traffic in that area is horrible so that might make it less great later down the road. This company really cares about each person's growth and development.
cons: I have been in the organization no more than 4 months and so far I can not put out concerning cons yet. But for now this two things in mind, first is that ever since I was exposed to virtual working that made it tough to do connections/interaction with local team mates. Second, the time difference with my manager. I am having little trouble with it since I can not be able to make the most out of our interactions as well.

[pros: Pays well, in general. If you are with the right group, the even-keeled engineering culture can be inviting. Work-life balance was good.

If you are young and are offered a good job, it might be a good place to get some experience, but keep your options open and keep scanning the marketplace, because you most likely won't get the opportunity to retire there.
cons: Every two years or so, it seems like they are doing some sort of re-org and priorities change, so it is hard to keep continuity with what one is doing. Some groups seem to value what you are doing for them; others, not so much. You never know what you are going to get. 

This time around, however, management made extremely bad decisions and 11% of the workforce is paying for it (regardless of what upper management wants you to think). So, the culture at present is rather toxic, I've heard. 

There tends to be a lot of political double-speak, phrasing things in palatable sounding business terms where you have to read between the lines to guess what people really think or in a particular situation what might have really happened.] =",terrible,bad,excellent

[pros: Benefits, PTO, and generous vacation time for part time employees, family/adoption assistance, discounts to other well-known businesses. They have this thing called the Homer Fund, that you can donate to every paycheck if you choose (even a dollar or two), which is saved up and used in extreme instances for people who work right in the store.  For instance, if someone is in a bad accident or has some type of medical issue, it might be used to help with medical costs. It's really great to know that the money will be used for someone you might know, when they really need it the most. I think it helps build the community atmosphere within the store as well.
cons: Like any large company, there are times when it can feel less personal, but management was usually understanding if there were any issues outside of work. While most of the dress code I understand, t-shirts are not permitted, even when you're outside in garden when it's 90 degrees out (but they're good about rotating out and keeping everyone hydrated).] =",excellent,good,excellent

[pros: As a leader in 911 call taking solutions, Airbus DS Communications has a crucial role in public safety. Your work here matters. And (mostly) our customers know that we're going to get the job done, support them well, and listen. Personally, I've met some great folks here - very willing and very helpful as you develop your potential.
cons: The company is owned by Airbus which has publicly stated that they're selling this entity. While it doesn't impact employees day to day, it is a cloud of uncertainty. I think there is concern that being ""for sale"" gives us a short term focus. Longer term strategic needs don't appear to be resourced well enough. Appears that often decisions on what to develop or support are driven by what has been sold to a given account vs what is most important for the viability of the company and the needs of the market.] =",bad,neutral,terrible

3. Some individuals have been doing the same job for 10+ years and have no motivation whatsoever - just waiting to retire
4. Not forgetting the fact that if you are external ( interim,consultant ) - You will be treated differently and there is no shame in the game with it - they will make you see that you are not ''staff''

There is a lot of people who are qualified for those jobs but unfortunately the wrong people are speaking on their behalf and using their titles as a deterrent for any question asked.  They really are the ones giving the company a side eye reputation when it comes to diversity.  Anyone they truly want to succeed they will and any one they deem not to succeed, they will not.

[pros: The employees (outside of leadership) are good, talented, and strong people who really want to contribute to the business, and are motivated to create good work. In theory, the brand/business itself would be exciting to work for, and contribute to, if leadership had a vision and goals for the brand, and subsequently their staff.
cons: There is no opportunity here, and if you're senior-level and looking to make contributions to the brand and the business, it won't happen here.  My role was positioned as a senior role, one where I would be providing a POV on content + copy for the marketing department, and one where I had autonomy and opportunity to be a decision-maker and lead the strategy of copy moving forward - it never happened.  Every project I was assigned was either killed, or farmed out to a third-party agency.  Every line of copy I wrote was rewritten. I never wrote anything that didn’t go through a considerable, unnecessary number of people – all from varying departments outside of marketing - for review/changes/iterations, and every person who reviewed my work rewrote the copy to the point I just began executing everyone else’s copy demands and ideas. Nothing I wrote actually “stuck” or got approved – and that was the circle. 

My workload was junior, and I went days and weeks where I had nothing to do or contribute: I’d write a couple of lines of copy for digital or social, but there was no actual business plan for how we were going to move forward in the marketing department: There was no campaigns, no original copy projects, no channels: all print, OOH, and television initiatives (et al) were assigned to third-party agencies, not in-house. A copywriter is meant to contribute to multiple aspects of the company's marketing mix, but that was the issue - there is no marketing mix. There was no marketing business plan - from the CMO or anyone in a leadership position - and when the department creatives would ask leadership for some perspective on what we were doing, or where we were going, they couldn't answer it. They didn't know themselves.  

The leadership micro-manages to the point any existing projects never fully get off the ground because they can't find unison in their decisions, so no decisions are ultimately made. Every deadline the department was assigned was missed - and that was standard practise. We never met a deadline because they were so loose to begin with. Projects just evaporated. We never fully realized a number of project initiatives; they just disappeared into the ether. 

There is no leadership: In my time,  a number of leaders were either demoted or fired, and there was no replacement. The creative department never had a CD, so we lacked structure and vision, and ultimately any sense of support or mentorship. The department doesn’t have anyone to advocate for the work, nor provide a strategy on where the department should go. Leadership is, at times, shockingly candid about how dysfunctional and lackadaisical the business is, to the point you wonder why you were hired in such an environment to begin with, and because of that, the level of gossip in the department is overwhelming and it lacks considerable professionalism and decorum.  

You won’t be promoted: There is no opportunity for growth, despite how much they may promise you in your interview. No one gets promoted or moves up the ranks. If you’re a junior, you won’t move up; if you’re a senior, you won’t have a future. Because there are no meaty projects or campaigns to work on, you have nothing to contribute to your portfolio. It's not an environment that will boost your career or make you a stronger creative; it has the reverse affect.  It got to the point where I was too concerned about jeopardizing my skills and my future career potential if I stayed.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: Base salary. (That's how they get you)
It says I need twenty words minimum but there really is not any pros so I need to fill space.
cons: You work in a basement. Management does not help develop you. The constant new hires well spread the manager thin so there will be little time for you. They go through account managers very quickly because of this. Most do not last a year they either quit or fire you. If I would of seen the amount of people they burn through before I came here I would not of gone. I spoke with a senior account manager over the phone from Avon. He made a joke about how he cannot keep our names straight because they go through so many account managers. Yeah I ignored that warning sign. Also on one of my first calls a customer complained about something mt had done in the past. She said that she told the previous two reps before me but nothing was done (the machine she gripped about was two years old). On another appointment a customer stated that they had my card already. Proceeded with showing me several different account managers cards. Didn't think anything of it then. I thought I was different that wouldn't happen to me I work hard. Wrong. Training program is very subpar  and the trainer seems to have no teaching experience, just a seasoned MT employee. When I was hired on I was expecting cold calling but not as much as there was. I was told there were a few call blocks a week to do. Which is true. But you are told to be on the phone all the time if you are in the office. 150 calls a week is the minimum. Don't expect hitting 150 makes you safe. Customers are also on 5 year cycles. They do not have a good base of customers for account managers to go into this job. Most of your business will be new through cold calling. I could go on with bad experiences but I think you get the picture. I would not recommend this job but of course I cannot stop you I can only share my experience. And it was not a good one.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Worked from home - lots of travel across the US.
cons: People are expendable - They would purchase and push a process only to abandon it a few years later which was a waste of  money and time. (Six Sigma)

- not paid month in band which makes for an easy financial transition into the job

cons: - dishonest management, hr and team leaders.
- assume anything said in interviews or training is a lie.
- LITERALLY NO ADVANCEMENT (see above for training lies).
- genuine illness, even if part of a reported disability will lead to bullying, victimisation from hr and management.
- ops managers were bullies.
- will break the law regarding disability discrimination/pregnancy therefore putting you at risk.
- management will lie, fabricate and   throw you to the wolves to cover their back.
- will strip any commission guaranteed for made up reasons if they don't have valid ones from the vast list of targets or change parameters at no notice even if already earned.
- take £400 or £200 off you for 'training value' if you leave/are fired or chased out with discriminatory practice before 6 or 3months.
- training is thorough but useless as job description is false due to lack of inter company transparency and cooperation.
- training managers are fake, super nice so you sign contract & can't leave without fines.
- unreliable system that they will blame you for. 
- spent all day listening to customers cry about client ruining their lives (all horror stories).  
- promised contractual pay increase not given until fought for.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Coworkers were great--passionate about putting out the best content for our customers, eager to work hard, friendly, kind, and ready to help out. Benefits are pretty good, and work-life balance is a high priority. Good severance packages.
cons: Upper management has thoughtlessly decimated content teams in SF to pay for (mediocre for the area) software engineer salaries, which they're hiring desperately to meet end-of-the-year goals for Pearson's new platform. Goals that will be missed, and probably result in stockholders shutting down the company. Even if the platform goes live, there will be no new state-of-the-art content to fill it, and customers will not be happy.

Prospective software engineers beware--perks are bad, with few paid lunches, a sad spread of snacks, and mediocre tools. Slack is being phased out to be replaced with Microsoft Teams by Fall.] =",terrible,bad,good

[pros: Young atmosphere with eagerness from some employees for more growth. 

Breakfast provided on payday fridays. 

401k Matching is fantastic. After a year they will match you 4% and you can take what you earned no mater how long you stay. 

Holiday activities were a perk, not sure if still happening.

You're selling and producing quality products, which gives you a good feeling.
cons: Where to begin... The hours are not ideal for most positions and not explained well upon hiring.

Pay is VERY LOW. College and non college degree employees make the same pay -when chances of a raise are slim, even after showing worth and asking for more at appropriate times. They will choose to hire a less experienced hire for a lower cost. Make sure you read and get a copy of all signed documents. They will try to screw you otherwise without any proof.

The owners say they value their employees, however prove time and time again that they do not. They will even stoop to the level of speaking negatively about them behind their backs. Not a good trait in an employer. Loyal employees feel degraded over time and the owners feel it as a personal attack when they choose to move on.

Production members are very under paid and overworked. Sometimes with crazy hours.

Accounting department is worse and are made to feel trapped in the company. VERY OVERWORKED. No overtime is paid and they work 10+ hours daily. I've seen it first hand.

Customer Service/ Sales is not trained properly and have a bad compensation structure. If you plan to live off your salary you better be aggressive- but don't promise more than you can because Signazon's capacity is only so much. The company is small and will continue to stay small as they lose more and more employees. In the time I was there we never reached over 50 and typically only had about 30 people on staff at a time. Turnover is high, very few employees stay more than a year. Marketing department was even at a count of 0 employees at one point. What does that tell you?

Office is in a more dangerous location after dark, I would suggest leaving early. However, that is not possible when the given a bad shift. Just hustle to your car when leaving.

Customer reviews and Yelp reviews are not always accurate- they will bribe customers to get reviews ""updated"". Beware.

Additionally, they will make you sign a no compete. From what I am told these do not hold any weight in Texas, but they will try to sue you if you do go to another sign company within a year of leaving. Keep your life as private as you can.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

The usual benefits of gas station work apply; fast-paced without being murderous, you'll get lots of customer service experience, etc.

Senior level management peoples also scare with employee who is technically good and handle all thing without taking any advice/help form senior level management. Lot of favoritism here. People who can butter can succeed in this organization. In this organization you need not be intelligent but have to be good in chaploosi too. There are multiple things to dislike

1.Office politics.

[pros: Getting the chance to work with some really smart people, more casual and easy-going work environment and dress code than most companies.
cons: This used to be a fun and creative company with a start up like culture, especially in engineering. No more! Unfortunately, under the new management (after Dara Khosrowshahi left) Expedia is fast turning into another boring corporation. This used to be a place where people had fun at work and enjoyed themselves. Right now it's a lonely place where people are hiding behind their headphones like at so many other companies. 

Mark Orkestrom seems to be a promotional CEO and even his laughter seems rehearsed. Personally, I don't trust much of what he says. A lot of the inspirational leaders like Aman Bhutani have been leaving in droves and have been replaced with careerists who try their best to make people work harder and harder. This leaves less time to work smart, be creative and come up with new ideas.

The company has been on a path to centralisation and unification which actively discourages trying new things and forces everyone to use the same tools and methodologies. On top of this you have the long term Expedia problems with company cult-like culture, active promotion of certain social and political views and constant re-organisations. The turnover is extremely high, to the point that there is not much stability at all. Getting a promotion is very difficult when your manager changes every year, sometimes even twice a year.

Last but not least benefits have been cut, for example the health care provider was replaced with one offering less benefits and encouragement for healthier lifestyle. 
Loyal employees are not really rewarded for sticking with the company. The 3 extra days leave people used to get after 5 years of loyal service have been scrapped. Personally I got a promotion without any salary increase at all. As a result a lot of loyal employees have been packing their bags in the last year or two.

No wonder the company is no longer anywhere near the best places to work in the UK on Glassdoor ,a list it used to top. Even worse, I feel that with the current management team Expedia as a place to work is heading only one way - down!] =",bad,terrible,terrible

Working on weekends is normalized. People normally give status in scrum meetings that either they would be working on weekends or they have worked on weekends.

cons: Only one I personally have is I'm used to doing multiple operations, and seeing my work from start to finish, as I now am doing finishing work as a rule.

[pros: Coworkers are friendly and helpful, which is great when you're still learning about the products.  Managers are easy to talk to and are flexible with scheduling.
cons: Even if you're there full time (35+ hours), they have to keep you at part time making $10/hour, which is not enough for spending that amount of time there each week.  The only real solution here is to get a second job, which is tricky because REI schedules only go out two weeks before you need to work, and it's physically pretty draining.  There is also a lot of pressure to sell memberships to customers, and this is how the managers track your quality of work.  The membership really is a useful thing to have, but it's hard to tack on an extra $20 when someone is already spending $300 on a jacket they'll wear for two weeks.] =",good,good,bad

cons: Always getting the runaround between department management, general managers, other store managers and team members. No one seems to know their right foot from their left foot. So the only thing left finally, is they blame HR for the results of any issues that they can't solve themselves. Sounds like they should desperately have meetings with HR on a regular basis so that everyone is on the same page, and so that the employees do not have to suffer like I was forced to.

[pros: You can work from anywhere as long as you have a relatively stable internet connection. Whilst I was there the salaries ranged from 9usd per hour to L1 support, 12usd per hour for L2 support, 15 usd for CSM, 18 usd for PEM roles, 27 usd for L3 and SCSM and about 30 usd for account manager. There is also probably a higher amount for the CEO. The salaries are quite good if you live in the developing world for example Philippines or India. The stable internet required is debatable at Versata/Dev Factory/Auto-Trol/Alterpoint/Gteam (and all Trilogy related companies) so I suggest to apply either way if you would like to as customers always complained about the lack of clarity from other agents due to accent or poor connection issues. However because most people in the developed world won't work for the low wages (plus the tough working conditions) the Internet connection requirements are relatively low. You work EST hours which is sometimes a bonus if you live only a few hours in front you can spend the day traveling, playing sports etc. You work with many different nationalities and get to hear different english accents around the company.
cons: If I could give 0 stars I would. Sadly 1 star is the lowest option at glassdoor.
Think customer service at Zappos or Dale Carneigie's How to Make Friends and Influence people, which sit on one end of the spectrum. On the other end of the spectrum is Versata/Dev Factory/Auto-Trol/Alterpoint/Gteam (and all Trilogy related companies) and the company you are considering to work for. 
Pricing is non negotiable. This is true for customers as it is for staff. The salary you receive is what your receive and you will stay on the same salary for the duration of the position (I knew one guy that was there for 5 years still earning the same 15 usd per hour). There are no public holidays. Only weekends are allowed to be taken off. Therefore if you are used to taking Christmas off, New Years day, Eid, Easter, Hanukah you have to ask for each and every day off and you will not be paid for it. Versata/Dev Factory/Auto-Trol/Alterpoint/Gteam (and all Trilogy related companies) buys companies really cheap does, uses obsolete technologies and provides very minimal technical support. The main support the company does provide is customer support so expect to be dealing with many angry customers if their complaint is something more than a simple managed upgrade. You have to monitor your time yourself, besides using the tracker they use  was Crossover and Upwork during my time. Monitor because it often fails. Also check your bank statement frequently if working Versata/Dev Factory/Auto-Trol/Alterpoint/Gteam (and all Trilogy related companies) they often forget to pay you or forget to refund you fees so it was often time I spent outside of office hours chasing them for payments and reconciling my time tracker not tracking correctly. Like a pro EST hours can be a con. The hours an non negotiable even if you have to be awake until 5am to fit into the company time scheduling. Be prepared to be fired without any prior notification. And when you are fired you are restricted access immediately one moment you thought you had a full time job and could support your family the next minute (literally) you have nothing. No 2 weeks notice, not even an hours notice! It's also very lonely. Unlike a typical office, of even factory for the matter that I have worked in there is very minimal time allowed to speak about anything outside of work. Make sure you have a great social life outside of work hours as I did not see many social bonds formed whilst working at Versata/Dev Factory/Auto-Trol/Alterpoint/Gteam (and all Trilogy related companies) . Also no one ever has one video call, in fact I was reprimanded for using my video camera. The CEO does not even have a video call with the customers and many workers don't even have a skype picture, as some seem ashamed to show that they work for a company like Versata. Mostly everything is documented in a knowledge based article that you are supposed to know. Often however the techical jargon is missing. Don't try to investigate outside of whats documented this company does not promote transparency, to the point that all documentation regarding revenue is hidden from the staff, for fear of complaint from staff on low salary to revenue proportions. Also they track your time by taking pictures of your screen and yourself every 10 minutes. Feels more like a factory then an office style work where every minute is always monitored of your work. Also the recruiting process is a bit excessive for some of the junior level staff CSM, L1 and L2. You will have to go through a one week trial, do 40 hours of tests unpaid and at the end you may not get the job hence not be paid for the work. Sometimes I've heard they remove the position half way through but don't tell people that they are not needed any more because there is nothing wrong per say. So can be a gamble even if you are good you still might not be needed and not hired after 40 hours of testing for Versata/Dev Factory/Auto-Trol/Alterpoint/Gteam (and all Trilogy related companies).] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: -nice talent acquisition team internally
cons: It is clearly and obviously a boys club. They are solely money motivated, their culture is gross and it is not improving, and they’re liars. It is a ‘sink or swim’ environment for employees. There is a not a supportive network - just selfish people self serving. The sales strategy largely revolves around pandering to big clients sourced through Telstra, giving free bottles of wine and being disingenuous. In 2021, the sales team had a ‘secret Christmas party’ that none of the other departments were supposed to know about. They explained that although customer service does hard work, sales brings the money in so we should get a special celebration. They flew everyone from Melbourne to Sydney, and put us all up in a 5 star hotel and chartered a yacht to go out over the harbour … and they insisted we didn’t have phones to take photos, post on social media about it, or talk to any other parts of the business about it. This creates segregation in the business, and a false sense of importance / inflated egos in the sales team. This was all spear headed by the problematic CEO Jeremy Wells. In addition, other executives at Whispir have exhibited a low level of morals and integrity. I am embarrassed to say in this review what I actually heard executives saying internally. Let’s just say they have a habit of making disgusting sexual comments when no women are in the room. It’s a boys club, and it’s just gross. They are not customer-centric (AT ALL) they are 100% money motivated. Although there was a HR team promoting D&I, and there were a couple of hero advocates in that space, I didn’t feel comfortable being myself around that judgemental and immature crowd. What’s more, this company completed misunderstood my value and relegated me to a low level position where I wasn’t being as effective as I could have been. They have inherent problems that will stay around as long as the executives remain in place.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

[pros: - work / life balance has always been consistent
- easy to get your foot in the door before working at another company
cons: - not competitive in salary, benefits, bonuses, etc. We are not only paid much lower in salary, but all other non cash benefits that we are missing out on add up. However, vacation for new employees has been recently bumped to 3 weeks which is a good sign. 
- no perks. We have a small lunchroom recently renovated (no TVs and not enough to fit employees at peak lunch time), and free ORCA cards. That's about it. 
- high turnover in the IS dept. Many know this as a starter company, and will leave as soon as they realize they can do better (< 3 years)
- the work isn't exciting. You should know this working for a company when you're building software for internal employees at a non tech company 
- many stuck in the ""old ways"" and not willing to keep up, or would rather hand-roll software solutions than look to outside sources. We've been been in a migration effort for many years.

cons: Intel is no longer a growth company.   The layoffs in 2006 were handled in a random and unprofessional manner which shattered the morale of the company. The real culprit was senior management being distracted with the Itanium processor while AMD out innovated Intel with Opteron to grab 30 percent of the server market share.  Intel is now attempting to grow by reentering the stand alone graphics market (which it failed at miserably in the mid-90s) and selling millions of Atom processors at $10 each.] =",bad,bad,good

2. Expectation is to take on more responsibility for at least 6 months before you are given any kind of salary increase or title change

There are many ""silos"" of knowledge within the company and often departments and groups tend to work against each other. There is not a lot of chances for upward mobility at the company and it has a very top down authoritative structure, with most managers staying in their positions for many years. Ironically, although Anritsu is a technology company, they tend to use outdated and archaic systems internally when there are many better alternatives that would increase efficiency.

- Yearly less salary increment is very less. Between 4-6% depending on your band. Which is less compared to the market/ other companies.
- They don't follow work ethics.
- Most of the HR doesn't help you to get the release from the project. They only listen to the management.
- Switching from ultimatix to another project/unit is very difficult. Managment says there is a policy project/unit change. But actually there is no policy for when you are allowed to change the ultimatix project.] =",neutral,bad,excellent

[pros: Some and I mean some of the incentives . The money can also be good if you figure out the system , very few do .
cons: I’ll start by saying my experience at Clearlink was far from short lived so I had the chance to see multiple departments even management roles within the company . They really want to promote a fun environment at Clearlink which is the case but be wary, there is a certain persona they are after and will always have the affinity for . If your 18-20 and want a start in sales I’d say this is an okay place for you . You will be surrounded by vapers and people more worried about causing a ruckus and drama than taking care of their job on a daily basis . There’s a reason the attrition is through the roof, they will hire ANYONE . Management is a complete JOKE . They put you on a team of 10-20 people and expect your manager to have time for you but they will care less until they want to nit pick your daily breaks / lunches and anything else unrelated to performance . Yet they will NEVER create goals with you and follow up on performance in a productive way to the sales rep . You WILL be treated like a child if you work here. In management, only the slimy / selfish type make it . I can honestly say I’ve only respected 2 of 10 + managers I’ve been acquainted with . I’ve seen so much fraud in this organization an entire department crumbled and VPs / directors got told to leave because of their sketchy ways . The money can be good here but it takes a certain personality type and very Cutthroat way of selling . I’ve seen thousands of dollars in commission go missing and never saw it turn up . I’d ask for an explanation over and over and would finally get a BS answer 6 weeks later . Never trust the managers . This place is honestly a JOKE, if you want to become a real sales professional look elsewhere .] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

cons: Coupon policy is a joke. We get punished for giving customers coupons but managers make us look like a fool when we refuse to give them one. They push for cashiers to get emails from customers, most customers are either already in the system or not interested. This resulted in most cashiers inputting fake emails to avoid hearing from management. Taking a break is looked down upon. Smokers get breaks but non smokers do not?? I pretended to smoke so that I would get a break. Customers are so so SO rude (mostly in regards to coupon policy). Minimum wage and no benefits or raises.] =",neutral,good,bad

There are definite cliques of workers who have been employed for longer periods, but the individuals in the cliques are nice when they are operating solo. The pay is ok, and requests for time-off are never refused. All things considered, if I had not been riffed, I would have stayed at least another year.

cons: When it comes to a company culture, TMA is ranked very highly. When it comes to salary? Not so much. They aren't very competitive with other companies which is why they lose out on great people.

[pros: Pay and benefits are extremely competitive; this was the highest offer I received out of every Aerospace & Defense company I had an offer from (including Boeing, P&W, and Northrop Grumman).

Technical education is a huge focus--I came in with my Master's degree, but there are plenty of good programs to get a graduate degree while you work (e.g. you can get paid your full salary while going to school full-time).

Amount of volunteer events and fundraisers is absolutely ridiculous (in a good way). It's hard to choose what to even go to. (Reposting my review from GE Aviation)
cons: Senior management can feel a bit far away--you will get Q&A sessions with them but only occasionally. It's hard to see the business from their perspective sometimes.

Lack of follow through.  During Covid, everything has been a PR ad.  No protection was provided to the DMs, they were asked to do MORE, working upwards of 90+ hours weekly.  No consideration for store teams. Compassion from senior leaders doesn't exist. They have no concern for anything except the $$$.

[pros: Great people and once you see what pay truly looks like as a civilian you do realize just how much you really did have it made while you were in financially. Once you get out you will see a big difference on how you're treated by friends, family, employers and complete strangers than before you joined once they know you're a Marine. While you're in, learn your MOS like your life depends on it because once you're sitting in front of a knowledgeable person interviewing you for a position at their company, you will regret every second you tried to skate out of doing your job. I promise, been there and done that.
cons: Long hours, command is always a toss up. You'll have to deal with higher-ups going to an unfamiliar culture for example: Ground side to air wing or vice versa to become ""well-rounded"", this usually ends up with an extremely annoying time for both sides of the coin.

[pros: To have a relaxed easy life without any work pressure, probably before retirement, this could be the perfect place. Great for having a life-life balance (notice the deliberate missing out of work)
cons: One should guess from the start of the recruitment process, that this is the place to avoid. A place which hires, regardless of which team you would work for, means your individual skills just don't matter. The technical content of the interview is just the online test, which is a cake walk compared to other companies. After that a team leader telephone chat is briefly technical, and then the only face to face, is with a senior manager, who stopped being technical more than 10 years ago! Agents will tell you to just show that you are keen to work in the airline industry and you will be hired! Besides, who you interview with, has no bearing on who you will work for. I never saw the manager or the team leader I interacted on the phone for the 2 years I worked there. Just before joining, one random manager gets given a new joinee, based on who requires a new robot to do the button pressing work that's all that goes on in this company. It has the most antiquated tools and process, which are so cumbersome and slow, one sometimes wonders if pushing paper between desks might be quicker than their processes. A one line code change can taken you a week to locate, a minute to do, and another 2 weeks to take through the laborious SDLC using a 19th century like bug tracking tool, which should be consigned to the history books. You make the code change, regression test it, get it code reviewed, submit a pull request. If that succeeded, you manually mark the change in the bugtracker as ""Approved"". Then you must remember to mark the code review state to ""Submitted"", otherwise the bug-tracker won't have the right state later on. Then a week later, when the code is loaded in UAT (thankfully not by you), you have to remember to mark your issue as ""Loaded test"". Then if you or some BA actually cares, you verify the fix works, or like many people asked me to do, just hit the next button on the issue ""Verified in test""! Then you may have to wait 2-3 months and come back to this issue again when the code is loaded in PROD (after several fallbacks), to mark the issue as ""Loaded in Prod""! Again, if you don't do it, some other tracking will fail which will annoy some managers. A lot of manual labour for a 1 line code change. Imagine this being your job on a daily basis!
Then the less said about the software the better. One encounters 1000 line C++ functions on a weekly basis. Yes, 4 digits, it's not a typo! People are too scared to refactor old code ""incase it breaks"". Well, given the recent public fiascos seen in the massive failures, it is no surprise such things are now falling apart. How can one possibly trace such long functions and make sense of the code. 
Recently,  a massive failure was attributed to the lack of code reviews. Then, code reviews became the new mantra of the day. The problem is senior management has no clue about how modern software should be written. They wrote and left this mess some 10 years ago, and now they are too late to modernise. Often they send emails reminiscing in the failures at past cutovers, almost as if celebrating failure.
On a daily basis there are issues with the tools that are taken for granted elsewhere, for example disk space for development, doing builds. There is never enough disk space to check out all the code to work on and it takes hours to build if you do manage to checkout all the code. Even after that the tool chain is so bad, that you can't tell if a build failed or passed without significant effort. 
The intranet pages also are terribly flaky, one or the other set of pages breaks several times a day.
The company doesn't have a test team! It relies a completely non-deterministic regression test framework, written by developers, which if they fail one night, the boss will tell you just wait one more day, it will pass tomorrow. Right enough the nightly failures would have passed the next day! It is a well known fact that there are scores of these regression tests which pass, but don't test anything of value. Many failures are blindly accepted as false positives when actually code remains broken, but the effect of it isn't seen till much later. If a test which used to ""pass"" before started failing, quite often, people put a sleep in the regression test to make it pass!
Some people have been making efforts to push unit testing of code, but it is a huge struggle with attitudes of old and new staff not being receptive to the idea, so it remains a pipe dream to make this a formal part of the process, which is what may actually add value, besides investing in an independent test team!
Whoever works there and leaves, doesn't say anything bad about the company at exit interviews, because, everyone who's been there realises that this is the place of last resort! If you can't find a a job elsewhere, you can always come back here, as the bar is so low!] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: You will get in shape because it's 4-5 hours of vigorous cardio every morning.  People are nice and very dedicated.
cons: You get hired at 4-9 shift, but really it's anytime between 3-4 depending on the day and ends anytime between 8-9.

If you are not willing to do this you won't have a job.  

The health benefits take a year to get them for yourself and a year and a half for your family.  With how strenuous the work environment is, if you got hurt before they kicked in you could be in trouble.  Also once they do kick in you are required to work minimum amounts of hours per week or the following week you would not qualify for health coverage.. so again, if you got hurt or sick and needed a week or two off work to recover, you would lose your health benefits for that time.  

Becoming a driver can take 1-3 years from when you start, but there is a lot of politics and training/testing to land one of those spots.  There are almost zero other full time jobs in the West Chester facility.

cons: Work / life balance and compensation.  Compensation was restructured two years ago and now raises, even for high performers, barely keep up with inflation.  It's really discouraging and people are leaving as a result.  You can't pay people poorly and then expect them to sacrifice work / life at the same time.

-for a financial services firm, very good benefits, 401k match, good vacation policy for associates and above.
-have worked with some really smart and dynamic folks
-socially conscious firm, it's not just talk
-if you work really hard and make a name for yourself, you will be acknowledged
cons: -stability BBH was once known for no longer exists. Divisions working exceedingly hard past few years to outsource jobs for the firm to Poland and India. Part of the game in this industry, but at same time BBH has worked so hard as a private bank to set themselves apart from their competitors. This just goes to show how they are turning the model to be just like their competitors. 
-nepotism runs rampant, if you don't know how to play the game, this place is not for you.
-there are some really fantastic senior managers that are women, but don't let that fool you. Still an old boys club, and more evident and in your face on the banking side.
-common theme throughout the firm, 'work more with less'. Makes managing a team 10x's harder because you now have to work extra hard to keep motivation levels up without sacrificing your teams quality or production.
-too many middle managers across the firm that don't know how to manage and lead, and allowed to get away with it.
-many slackers still remain, while we watch the future talent walk out the door (or get laid-off!) due to low morale and low pay.
-have watched this firm change from great to very dysfunctional over the past 10 years. A big disappointment considering I once held this firm with the highest regard and had deep respect for my past managers.] =",bad,terrible,bad

The benefits
Rental Incentive

The work life balance
Community service involvement in the Rogers office
More laid back attitude in the Rogers office than other offices
cons: The bureaucratic nature of the company is out of control. Promotions are being based off tenure in role or time with the company versus performance. We're losing really smart, innovative people because of it.
Some jobs are incredibly boring.
Staying in one business center limits your career path options. Minneapolis is a must if you want to advance your career.
People are always worried about little things like what time you leave or what shoes you're wearing. Not as much in the Rogers office as other locations but it is a company wide issue.
Senior management makes all the decisions and doesn't appreciate when younger employees interject their true opinions.
Lots of managers like to do things the way they've always been done before and have no desire to innovate and provide something new.
Recognition of truly great work needs to be more than just an email. Make people feel like they truly earned a big pat on the back from the company.
No one in senior management likes to take responsibility when things go wrong. There's always a ton of finger pointing.] =",neutral,bad,excellent

[pros: Nice environment, merchandise, discounts.mutual friendships if mangement doesn't interfere.
cons: Making the numbers is probably the biggest reason for stress and or  quitting.! It is set up to where you have certain expectations and  at the end of year review- if you are over your numbers by 15 %, for example, you get a pay raise that's formulated as equal to that 15 percent mark.
But here's the downside- you might be 15 or 20, or even 10 % below your numbers, on a given review date(that's pre-set a year in advance and you already know that by checking i in a dash board like computer system).... then you face that pay rate equal to that percentage deficit from your standard number range and ...this is   explained in the written  review(s)s you[should] have monthly and during orientation when you are first hired. 
It caps off at 50 % over  though 
 so if you make $12/ hr, and are doing an average of 50% over that in sales per hour goals, i forgot to mention taking into account the returns that AD to your  daily numbers and maintaining that-yearly-making more than you do in returns that is--  the most you can get is a 50 % pay rate (People barely get 15 percent over)..Very few people get that far and  if they do they go elsewhere once they have reached this limit. As they feel there are no more rewards for trying so hard.How sad when you get familliar with someone and they leave.Which is what Dillards thinks sets them apart from the competition. Such is life but customer service???  You are expected to make that much more in sph automatically if you do get pay raise..You are paid basically what they feel you are worth.] =",bad,bad,none

Going up the company ladder under the management umbrella is much easier near limitless.  Oddly, you can be leader and have people who are a higher labor working for you.  Despite the huge amount of training classes available, very few of them are actually offered.] =",neutral,good,good

[pros: The pay is better than most other employees in the building. The ability to work with newly released cosmetics and fragrances is rewarding, we are able to sell the things we love and then earn commission for it! There's a little more freedom for Beauty Advisors to get their job done- as the Beauty Lead does most of the day's/weeks/months planning without a store manager changing the flow of things. Another pro is the ability to do makeovers on clients in our own department- we are supplied with a belt full of makeup brushes~ 
Oh yes, the discount is nice.
cons: There have been MAJOR changes lately. Lack of structure, organization, communication, and feed back to be exact. Kohl's Beauty was once a place where vendors would visit to educate the employees on the brand, where beauty would recieve videos to or other sources with knowledge on the product- no more. It is apparent that there is a new Head of Beauty in corporate land- and they stopped attempting to reach out to it's employers. People go to Kohl's to save money, period. When I first began my job, coupons were eligable on a handful of fragrances and then slowly turned to NO fragrances, now the whole beauty department is not coupon eligible- even merchandise that is discount eligible in other stores, this is HURTING commission. Shelves are empty, graphics are months and months old due to wrong ones being sent- and if you don't plan on carrying the load of an entire department between the three (or two), prepare for a failing sales plan. 
In addition, management is notorious for not including Beauty as part of it's family. We are the black sheep. When it's a busy weekend and the lines are long, a beauty advisor can be stuck at the register for hours until the line dies down, missing out on any customer who might need assistance in beauty.] =",bad,bad,terrible

[pros: The pets, most of the pet parents, and most of my coworkers. The free apparel (Halloween, #inspiredbypets shirts), and the holiday gifts given to employees were awesome.
cons: Store management.  Terrible.  They did what they wanted and did little real work, but demanded unrealistic expectations from their employees and chastised/punished (cut hours, gave stink eyes/cold shoulder etc) when it wasn't done to their standard. Management style was absolutely 100% fear based and not constructive whatsoever. Employees were intimidated and constantly in fear to talk to management because it never led anywhere except being punished, either directly or indirectly.  Not to mention if you would come to the assistant manager with something they would tell the store manager, the pets hotel manager, and basically talk about you behind your back with the entire store, when you would assume what you've told them was to be confidential. Incredibly unprofessional and against policy.  Open door policy here was a joke. I know of at least 2 complaints on store management for sure that were told to corporate by current (at the time) employees and of at least one investigation into the management in the store that came of one of them, but it resulted in absolutely nothing. The problem is that management was always notified whenever a corporate level employee was to visit, so of course management would straighten up and be on their best behavior.  Kind of defeated the purpose.  Last I knew, this member of management that was absolute poison to the store and employees underneath them still works there.  Absolutely sad and a huge fail on corporates part.

All senior and management level promotions or raises and quarterly reviews here are based on popularity, not by actual skill, ability, or performance. If you're not a senior or a manager or in management's sights to become one, you're given terrible reviews despite how hard you actually work, and you're treated like a slave. The best way to describe it.
 
In the pets hotel when there would be multiple camps running each associate would be stuck in the same camp with the same 16 or 12 dogs for their entire 8hr shifts with their only break being lunch break (for the dogs), or their 30min lunch. And you NEVER got out for break on time.  No switching camps for a change of scenery or a bit of a break. You were stuck with what you had for 8 hours. Seniors and assistant manager would hang out in the pets hotel managers office all day (with the manager)  and play on their cell phones, order food and eat, and generally just hang out all day while the associates did all of the work and suffered.  God forbid they had to relieve anyone for a break.  They acted like it wasn't their job or something. During lunch hour where individual playtimes were done (again. Associates job. Seniors did nothing), we would get radioed over the walkies and asked how much longer the dog had for their playtime. If you said 10 minutes they'd tell you that it was fine and to bring them back and start the next one. So basically people that paid for 30 mins or an hour of play time got ripped off and their dogs got shorter play times. A few times if the dog had regular playtime and did literally nothing for its whole play time (which was about 80% of the time,  we would suggest that we let the pet parents know so that they didn't keep wasting money on it and management would tell us not to worry about it. Pet parents never had a clue and to their knowledge their dog had a blast and burned all it's energy off, so they continued to pay for it.  We were also instructed to lie on the daily report cards and no matter how unlively the dog was in camp, to say that it participated and had fun so that they would keep paying to bring their dog. We had several dogs that were regulars that were obvious they absolutely hated being there. But I'm sure their owners never had an ounce of a clue. Very dishonest business conduct and low morals/standards in 90% of authority figures. It was sickening. 

I don't know if stores in bigger districts are conducted better and Alaska is just the store everyone forgets about, but this store was (hopefully isn't still) hell on earth. I don't see how that would make sense since it's probably the smallest district, I would think it would be easier to manage, but who am I to say? 

After working at this store I will never work for another petsmart again. Not only because of store management at this particular store leaving a bad taste in my mouth, but it provided insight into how the corporate side works. They don't care about the employees that make their business, and even after receiving complaints from their own employees they sweep them under the rug and continue to let their employees be abused by and treated unfairly by management.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Fast paced at times, Friendly co workers
cons: The schedule always fluctuates every week and it doesn't really allow a lot of time for family and friends. Coverage in each department has always been an issue, there will one person in the department that's scheduled from 6:00 am to 3:00 pm then they have someone else that doesn't come in till 6:00 pm or there's nobody else scheduled. It's always hard to get from from each department when customers come up to you and demand that you call someone from that department. When they don't show up or if there's nobody scheduled in that department the customer blames the cashier, especially when they need help loading something and i try to call for loading and most of the time, they don't schedule a lot of lot people on certain days, so it's been really frustrating.

[pros: This is a good company for self-driven individuals. If you have no issue going after the knowledge you want to succeed at your job and are a people person by nature, you will succeed. There is a good amount of autonomy to make your own schedule and meetings.
cons: The lack of innovation with respect to marketing strategies/product launch campaigns, internal communication, and customer service often consumed a lot of time that should have been devoted to selling and building relationships.  There was a disjointed feeling among the groups about the company's mission. An attitude and cohesive message should come from the top. Unfortunately the bulk of your communications from upper management would be about quarterly sales numbers, setting up meetings for them because they wanted to travel in your territory (for no apparent reason) and what were your greatest 'fires' that required their attention. The potential is there. Only time will tell.] =",bad,neutral,bad

cons: It is a rapidly growing company and industry and you have to be able to pivot and adapt to an ever changing environment. Your plan for the day may only be good until the first shot is fired. Hours and work/life balance can become gray in this type of environment as we are all working so hard to deliver the best.

[pros: The benefits are good, nice cafeteria and work location.
cons: I was explicitly told, ""Fake being perky or you'll be written up"" in a performance review with my Team Lead.  If you were a quiet introvert (like me), you had to go out of your shell or get in trouble.  Someone actually complained to my Lead because I only smiled at them in the hallway instead of verbally saying ""good morning.""  Really?  

They always hired outside the company for management positions in the Licensing Department.  There was no opportunity for advancement; they would dangle a ""promotion"" (no more money, just a title) in front of you like a carrot.  Then at your next one-on-one, they'd say ""work on A and B to get this promotion.""  Then at the next one-on-one, it's ""ok now work on C and D.""  You were never good enough.  

They also value personality and friendliness over whether you could competently do the job.  I eventually left because an immature coworker was inciting drama and making fun of me on a daily basis, often right to my face, and management did nothing.  The last I heard, he'd been promoted to a senior position on the team.

The quality control process is a joke.  With 80+ decision points to make on one piece of processing, if you made even one error, the item was ""failed.""  They were told over and over again by every single new person to the team that using ""failed"" was detrimental to the well being and morale of the employees, and they didn't care.  They told us that it would not ever be changed.  QA failed work if they didn't like you, and passed work from people that they were buddies with.  Too many failed pieces of work and you were disciplined.  I had a 96% success rate - the highest on the team - and yet I was never promoted because I'm a quiet person and other people misread me as rude or stuck up.  My manager never went to bat for me.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Honestly nothing that I experienced could be considered a Pro
cons: Company is siloed and too big to get anything done. Training was sub par at best (online only). Health benefits were extremely costly and 401k was 5% but the funds they offer were few and had really bad returns. Worked for them for 10 months and they came after me to recoup the full amount of my signing bonus. They even sent collections after me to get it.

I think that the executive leadership at Marc Benioff's level and direct reports have been great. Forward thinking, innovative, beginner's mind, etc.
cons: - The senior leadership and some of the middle leaders in this department clearly does not align with Salesforce as a company. We sit in employee town halls discussing flex time and working from home, but the leadership in this department wants to micro manage their teams and press their thumbs down on everyone. This department has been watered down so much in the last several years and we constantly hear about how we need to ""lower the cost to serve"" while also trying to shove case closures down everyone's throats.] =",terrible,bad,bad

[pros: Seeing as the company offers its service to many other company's, there's always plenty of opportunity to move. There's potential to build a career with Yoh if you choose or build a career with the company you're contracted to work for as well. You get to know people from both company's.
cons: From my stand point it most likely all depends on who your client is, but management was always more worried about making the client happy than working with and standing up for their employees. I get that there has to be a certain amount of making the client happy, they're your client, but as a manager, you need to support your team and help make them better employees (i.e. - help set goals to move their career forward, help guide them).] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: My branch was wonderful.  My co-workers, for the most part, got along well.  The branch is given incentive to get investment and banking referrals to me.  For someone with decent sales skills and investment background, this isn't difficult job at all.  I would have loved to stay with this company, as I could see how my efforts were helping the branch's bottom line.  Management was pleasant.  Salary was competitive.
cons: Although management was pleasant, they weren't very helpful.  I was refused credit on multiple banking and investment closes.  My referrals would sit there, and without any explanation, they would just not pay you.  There is a faulty system they use for inquiries into why you didn't get paid, and to have it corrected.  Always, my requests were declined, even though it was clear I was the key factor in the transaction.  My branch would get acknowledged for my efforts, but I would have no credit.  I learned that just about everyone in sales has had PNC deny them pay for closes.  People talk about it, with acceptance.  It boggles my mind.  The systems are horrible, and malfunction regularly.   

They have too much overlap between this program and their Private Client Group position.  They lie and tell you there's no conflict or competition, then they put you in the ring and wait for the cat fight to break out.  

At least in my region, the men in this position have private offices and the women have desks in the lobby.  My desk was three feet from my bankers and in ear shot of everyone in the lobby.  Not a good way to have wealth conversations.] =",bad,bad,excellent

[pros: You get to figure out how to run a business on your own and you get to meet many great people.
cons: Figuring out how to run a business comes with a cost. The pay is very low with the amount of stress you have trying to run the business. You are constantly being questioned why your store didn't do well even when you had 20 customers for the 11 hours you are open. If you don't get online sales, upper management is down your throat, even though you are trying to sell in the store. Oh that makes sense... As a manager you aren't allowed to hang out with your associates outside of work because it is playing 'favorites.' That kind of sucks especially if you move 4 hours away from your friends to work and some of your associates are your age. Hours are absolutely ridiculous. Whoever makes the schedule doesn't give a rotation for management to have 2 days off in a row or even a weekend so you can be with your family once in your life. I understand it's retail, but seriously think of the work/life balance of your employees. When you ask to take a day off you feel awful because you think the other manager is going to be mad. I'm not even going to get into politics because they are obviously running the show.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

[pros: The company does well against its competitors such as Finisar. RSU stocks are great.  We get twice a year bonus. The key is you have to negotiate your compensation package. Never settle for less. Aim high. What do you have to loose? If you already have a job, you would be in good shape to negotiate your salary. If you are laid off and looking, they will use that against you. But that is true with all companies.

It’s all about hire date, when it comes to PTO Schedules and certain perks. Also since they cant get rid of the trash employees if your 3 years or less with company expect to be forced moved to other locations for headcount balancing.

Because leaders and people come in from different company's with ideas but are quickly shut down they end up leaving.

[pros: English-ish environment. IT is mostly English but lots of important functions like HR are mostly Japanese.

They are trying to create a silicon valley spirit in Tokyo.

Free food but you quickly get tired of the same menu/rotation.

I put 5 stars at work/life balance because I could literally do my daily tasks in less than 1 or 2 hours. It's a great place if you have no ambitions.

You can get promoted even if you do a mediocre job (although raise is virtually non-existent).

If you are a foreigner, there is no expectation/pressure to do overtime.

Company is somewhat LGBT friendly.
cons: I honestly believe that management has no idea what's going on. This is a boat sailing without a captain and without a destination.

There is no real innovation although the president invented the word ""Innoperation"" (from Innovative and Operations) to describe the company. I'm not sure if the company is doing ""Innoperation"" but it's clearly inoperative. 

Salary is lower than most places (I call this the ""non-native speaking tax"" so I guess it's understandable to some extend).

Your starting salary will remain almost the same even if you do well. There's the official HR evaluation system and then there's the ""informal system"".

There's ""church"" to attend on Monday mornings where the CEO talks pretty much non sense about his vision (or lack of). He tries to dodge questions that he's made aware of in advance (I participated, your questions are pre-screened and it's all smoke and mirrors).

Don't expect help from managers. They ""manage"" (whatever that means) and spend their days in meetings.

The turn over is crazy high. You might end up being the senior in your team with practically no knowledge on how to do/fix things.

Although the company claims to be diversified, there is clearly a wall between locals and foreigners. It may or may not be ok for some people.] =",terrible,bad,excellent

[pros: Competitive salary and benefits. Nice office location.  Not much else.
cons: There is a ton of incompetent or simply inexperienced mid level leadership. Business unit leadership does not communicate to their people so important information never gets shared properly. Executive leadership is all going different directions and decisions take too long or change with the winds. Unmanageable personnel growth is troublesome and leaders are spending money like its water on all the wrong things. They need to reign in the expenses or they won’t be around long. 
Exempt staff is overworked and not appreciated. Leadership at all levels is very old school and needs to change the culture if they want to attract and retain better talent. 
Work is still mostly done manually. Even though there are systems and software available to do it better and faster, current decision makers will not spend money where it actually matters. 
Bullying and discrimination by upper level managers goes unpunished. They are allowed to break very basic EEOC laws and get away with it. HR only supports leadership and is definitely NOT the friend of line employees.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Most employees in non-management role and a handful of management are great. Good benefits

The most hardworking employees do all the work, but no credit. When a project is close to being complete, it is reassigned to management's favorites. Discrimination and retaliation is the norm and encouraged, and HR protects the management. Fear-based management causing the best employees to flee as they are taken advantage of. EEOC should be involved considering what management and HR are doing are unethical and unlawful. All levels of management are out of touch with the employees.

cons: Employee paid parking or fight for a spot in the free areas at corporate offices. Unrealistic goal expectations must talk fast do your job effectively Constant criticism. Lack of management support (due to managers being over worked by higher ups/company delicacies. Insufficient and rushed training. No time off calls to get more help with understanding with specific areas of concern directly with a superior. No delegated assistant managers that are available to help during their shift because they have them on calls too but expect them to have time to help customers and us at the same time which results in delayed help and longer calls. Expected to explain details related to personal or health issues if you need time away or are stughling at work (which legally they cannot require you to release that but they make you justify yourself anyways) ethics line complaints are sent to hr who works on site and managers are notified even though they tell you at the beginning of the call that your information is confidential and will not be shared. Multiple systems fail consistently yet we are required to service customers and the time your system is down is counted against your adherence which makes it look like you just logged off to have a party! 30 days given after being wrote up for poor performance, if not met within that time you’re terminated. Required to promote tools that help customers use digital services instead of calling in (because it saves the bank money) which will eventually lead to our jobs being lost. Lack of trust in employees morale and education on banks policies and procedures and not given ability to service customers when it comes to difficult situations/unique circumstances, without consulting with upper management who are unwilling to help if they’re in a bad mood. Management dont have much more authority than employees do. No one knows what dept to transfer callers to nor Are bankers taught what department services what.

All these things may seem small but when the new VP comes in and tells us that Time Warner has been paying us too much that is a bad sign. They will not allow us to transfer internally for 6 months since they put us in the new role. People who have been there 10 to 15 years are being pushed out because their base is too high. There is no room for career advancement within Spectrum/Charter like there was at Time Warner.

[pros: Benefits, Company Vehicle (If you can somehow manage a work life balance to take time off)

Only Pro I could think of honestly
cons: Started with this company thinking it was where I was going to spend my future career. Upon the end of our Work-From-Home time we were sent back into the field with unrealistic expectations. 
After a while they decided to change the bonus structure to base it on what volume your entire territory does. 
After a while they decided to increase the call coverage (amount of times you go into each store). Some of us have been having to drive upwards of 4,000 miles just to achieve the same coverage as people who live in cities. The ones that live in cities have 100 stores in a 10 mile radius, while rural assignments have 100 stores in a 120 mile radius. Usually the folks in the city have to achieve 140 calls in a month , while most rural assignments are upwards of 150-180 calls. How is this fair?

Since BAT took over this job has been nothing but a joke. They scared off the only person in home office who cared about the Trade marketing team(Mike Auger). The TMs in the field were highly respected and regarded for their work and were always recognized. At this point and time it just seems like we are robots and nothing but a number to them. It is hard to keep a positive outlook when constantly new work expectations are coming down the pipeline while nothing is being changed or removed.
Random calls set up for 2 hours to talk about what is going on at Home Office and how their workload is going to change, but no mention or recognition of the Trade Marketing Team. It is an embarrassment.
They just want to appease the share holders and keep loading up their own BAT pockets.

Anyone on here with a positive outlook on the company has probably been paid off by their SDR in “WOW” points just to attempt to increase the rating. 

Our biggest competitor (Altria) half the time doesn’t even have their employees in the field, yet they are paid more, drive better vehicles and are taken care of better. 
Our other competitor (ITG) starts their employees at almost the same pay to take care of dying products. 
We have the biggest variety of products as opposed to our competition, yet we are severely underpaid. 

With the severance package coming up, I am sure home office is going to be shocked by the amount of people willing to happily walk away from this job. 

The culture is completely non existent. It’s just work hard, work hard some more, and continue working hard.

[pros: I worked as a Weight Loss Consultant in a Jenny Craig Center on the East Coast for two years. I worked part time (25 hours) during college and then went to full time (38 hours) once I graduated. I had a great experience and the job was a great fit for me at the time. The position was largely commission based, so the paychecks were not exactly the same every time, but I feel that I was fairly compensated. A little bit of sales knowledge was necessary to maximize every sale and in turn maximize my paycheck. Even if we were very busy, everyone pulled their weight because they knew that their paychecks would be impacted based on their contributed amount of work.

Helping people lose weight was a wonderful experience. It was great to be there with my clients every step of the way. A lot of my clients credited me with their weight loss success and thanked me endlessly. Of course they did all the work but it felt wonderful to be an inspiration to my clients.
cons: The compensation is largely commission based, so it was a competitive environment among my female colleagues. There were also strong personalities that did not always mix when working in such an environment. In my center, there were some clear rules on when you should get credit for a sale and when someone else should get credit for a sale, and as long as everyone did the right thing, there were no problems.

There was not much room for growth. As a consultant, when my Center Director left, I wanted to be considered for the Center Director role with my newly obtained college degree. I was told that I needed to first move up through the appropriate levels including being a Program Director for at least a year. I was not interested in being a Program Director and ultimately left the company for an external corporate position.] =",good,good,excellent

Annual performance reviews appear to be on a bell curve and scores are generated with little input from your immediate supervisor, though this process is widespread in industry.

[pros: Intelligent, thoughtful colleagues. The atmosphere isn’t as cutthroat as I’ve experienced at other firms. Some very high profile clients and the firm has been rapidly growing over the past few years. Great medical and dental benefits!
cons: Despite the fact that the firm is growing and profitable, the salaries - corporate and consulting - lag behind competitors. Although, some of that depends on who is your manager. I enjoy my job & colleagues but I know that if I had a different manager, I would have been promoted much sooner. It’s discouraging to work so hard when your manager has no idea what you do. The main reason I’ve stuck around is because of the people although I’m at the point now where a healthier paycheck is more important to me. Too many 3% COL raises which don't even keep pace with inflation. Also, the firm is starting to put most of your annual salary increase in the form of a bonus rather than a typical wage increase. There are numerous reasons why this isn’t ideal; I could write 2 pages on this topic.] =",good,neutral,bad

[pros: Servant leadership approach sets the stage for the culture.  I remember my boss once telling me that the hierarchy is flat, from the dishwasher to the CEO.  If there is a decision that needs to be made and we need a tie breaker then they will raise their hand but everyone is valued, everyone has a voice and everyone is treated with respect and dignity.  In my previous company I was exposed to an incredible culture working from an entry level position into management over many years and I never thought I would find another company that would match this.  Well Aegis has exceeded this bar and then some.  When you have a company this size, serving employees coming from all walks of life and pay scales they're always challenges, some inconsistencies and the reality is that everyone isn't always happy.  We live in an imperfect world but the difference with Aegis is they listen, they change and they care.  The emotional intelligence residing in this company is the difference for me.  Bottom line is that I love coming to work everyday and I am grateful to work for a company that is so committed to the experience for their employees and their residents.
cons: We have the honor of caring for amazing seniors and the reality is that many of them are extremely frail.  While it's humbling to care for this vulnerable population, it's also emotionally draining at times and difficult to deal with the loss.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

[pros: Target has a great reputation in the community and we were very involved with giving back.

Senior Group Leaders have full authority over your career and if they do not care for you they will work you out by any means necessary., as long as the center is performing, nobody at home office cares.

[pros: No Pros about this company.
cons: TE is severely out of touch with their facilities and their employees. 

Everyone at this particular ""site"" had a lot of contempt for management because of the way they were treated.  At this particularly facility management continuously created a toxic working environment which led to employees with increased stress levels and the ambulance being called a few times. When one employee injured themselves and did not provide a doctors note, they were terminated immediately. No questions, no inquiries. I believe a lawsuit was underway with the employee in question.

This is the same company, Tyco Electronics, that was caught in a 600 million dollar fraud scheme a few years back. Seems like a lot of seedy people, to say the least, run this company.

Most managers here can't even use excel, and always add scope creep to projects. You will never get your full bonus here, and often time the criteria for your bonus changes mid year.

[pros: There are some genuinely good people there (or there were good people there - recent layoffs have gutted the place).  Benefits are OK and work/life balance is OK.  It is great to work with well-known brands like Sonic and Crazy Taxi.
cons: It is a Japanese run company.  It is impossible to get anything (and I mean ANYTHING) done in the US side of the business because the Japanese execs mistrust the US execs. Its a long term problem within Sega and it has caused them to miss so many great opportunities.  You know how you keep on reading about Sega's gloried past? This is why its in the ""past"" - there's nothing left there now.
The HR staff will go out of their way to enforce arcane rules that have no bearing on real-world problems.

[pros: QTS is doing better every day. One day, they might actually become what they strive to be. Superficially, the facilities are beautiful. Just don't look beneath the surface.

The benefits package greatly improved over time, and the training opportunities became much more robust. 

Executive leadership is actually pretty involved and easy to talk to. If they take the necessary steps to fix middle management, the company can be great.
cons: -Everything looks great, but is usually a result of cost cutting. This means there's little consistency between sites and even between rooms in the same facility. 

-Training is available, but you have to follow their path. If you're not interested in the specific certifications they want you to achieve, you'll eventually face some kind of punishment, but they never go into detail of what that is. Most people leave before they find out.

-There is little accountability. This is true within teams and between departments. If you don't have a specific contact, then odds are good you'll be on your own to fix whatever problems arise. If someone doesn't follow through with their obligations, it's up to you to fix. 

-Standards exist for a reason. Either follow them or don't, but don't pay them lip service and ignore them. 

-Management needs some serious training. Our team lost everyone over the course of a year and half. At one point it was all taken up the chain only to be ignored. The same manager that caused the problems is still there and still committing the same mistakes. This is a common theme and the reason I left.] =",terrible,bad,excellent

[pros: None I can see - Free coffee and tea maybe ?
cons: - No work/life balance. Overtime is rather not tolerated, but stress at work is so huge at times that it impacts a lot on your self being. Lots of angry customers on the phone. Pressure within the team is also high as worst employees get the less job, best employees get the more job. 

- No training provided for some projects. How can someone handle a whole project being trained for a couple of hours ? 

- VERY bad quality management. Management doesn't care about your performance, they care about your 1 min late at work, they care about that one mistake you will make although you've perfomed 100 successful taks. No team restructuration, no inquiries are listened to. People taking main decisions don't know what they are doing. 

- Insane supervision. You have to justify litterally everything. 

- Poor, poor, carreer opportunities. It is not the performance that counts, it is how many years you are working for the company that counts.

- Apparently the company has a bonus system, which should be given every 3 months. Never heard of it then even though my performance was considered as excellent.

[pros: My review applies to engineering departments.
- Pretty laid back
-Most people and colleagues are very nice
-Good learning opportunities if you are out of college and don't have any experience
-Job security. You don't get fired unless you really mess up
-Nice and clean buildings/facilities
-Willingness to invest on R&D projects, vertical integration
-Location
-Espresso machines everywhere
-OK medical-dental-life
cons: -If you are an experienced or highly technical engineer, avoid this company. The company policy is to hire fresh graduates who can't find any other job, pay them very low, and don't care if they leave. 
-Managers are highly incompetent and most of them are there due to nepotism or being with the company for a long time. Some engineering managers even don't have a college degree! It is a private company and managers are those who are in owner's circle. I am sure if it was a public company most of them wouldn't be hired at all.
-Very low pay. The company philosophy promoted by the upper management is to make cheaper medical devices to bring health care costs down. This has led to being cheap in many other things, including salaries and raise. 401K is up to 2% of salary, 0.5% match.
-No clear path for professional growth!] =",terrible,terrible,good

[pros: 1] Few good top management have survived the cheap politics played by sarkari type lateral management
2] Still better company among other service companies 
3] Policies are much better
cons: 1] Variable pay is disbursed twice a year & its percentage depends on mysterious factors. 
2] If your variable is 15% of your fix, then you may get average 7%.
3] If you ask for roll off from project, then you are given PIP.
4] If you are release from project just during performance evaluaion process (june) then you are likely to get 0% hike (except for TOP handful performers).
5] Advanced Java developers are hired & somehow forced to work on selenium automation
6] Business Analysts/MBAs are put on Application Support Projects
7] Accenture Pune Management is full of Ex-Infosys management, hence company is loosing its work culture (as attrition rate is high.)
8] if notice period is reduced 2 month, then attrition rate will surely spike.

[pros: Awesome sales training & managing your own territory is stressful but you learn a lot about time management
cons: Micromanaged the entire time. If you are not entering data properly within an understandable time a manager will call you or email you questioning why. They say it is a ""family"" run business however the CEO & Executive board as seen as a big brother. Always used as a threat to do better. When reps struggle instead of looking for solutions they pile more nonsense on top and yoh start to sink. There is 0 product training so you look like a dummy 1/2 the time. Service department is horrible- so even if you do make a sale, they can't even follow up properly to ensure your customers you sold are satisfied. No one takes responsibility.

[pros: The social aspect of being a Brand Rep is definitely the best part.

Also if you're on a 0 hour contract its perfect for fitting around education and at my store we have a Facebook group so picking up and giving away shifts is easy too.
cons: You only get paid £6.25 per hour so if you're at uni you'll probably need another job or some other way of getting money. You also don't get paid anything extra for working on Sundays, Bank Holidays, unsociable hours or other events like Black Friday, Boxing Day, Christmas Eve etc. Almost everyone I've met through Hollister is unhappy with the pay and only stays because it is such a great place to work.] =",excellent,good,bad

[pros: It's difficult to identify any significant pros about working at Root Inc.
cons: Root Inc has a work culture that can be unbearable for employees. The culture is a blame-game, leading to an unhealthy and unsupportive work environment. The management team at Root Inc lacks the necessary skills to lead and support their team effectively. Their decisions often negatively impact employees and the company as a whole. Root Inc expects employees to work long hours without appropriate compensation for overtime. This leads to poor work-life balance and high levels of burnout among employees. Root Inc offers compensation below industry standards, which is not commensurate with the workload and expectations of employees. Additionally, there is a lack of transparency around bonuses and salaries, which creates a sense of mistrust. Root Inc does not provide employees with opportunities for professional development or career advancement. This leaves employees feeling stuck in their roles and unfulfilled in their careers. Overall, Root Inc is a highly unsatisfactory place to work. The toxic work culture, ineffective management, and inadequate compensation and growth opportunities make it an unappealing workplace.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

cons: Take a look at all the 5 star reviews for this garbage company. All of them are short, and state “no cons that I can think of.” What kind of company doesn’t have a single con?? Every other non 5 star review is completely accurate. Geico is the Amazon of the insurance world. This company sells garbage to people who don’t know any better and they do it with a smile on their face. 

Take this review as your first red flag before beginning your “career” with GEICO. 

You will be an answering machine
You will not have any input on how you do your job 
You will do it their way, or they’ll give you a box
You will not be happy
You will be wasting your time
You will not make a difference in the company

[pros: Great place to start as a first time job. If you can work here, retail anywhere else would be no problem. 

Benefits are great if you are a full time. 401k offered. 

Does offer commission on certain sales.

Does invest in associate training that you can take with you to the next job or career.
cons: You will be multi tasking a ridiculous amount if you are a manager, senior sales consultant, or logistics. It will be stressful when you don't have enough coverage for departments that need it during rush hours. Particularly referring to Copy and Print department. 

The company's policy changes way too often. You have to adjust to new rules on customer engagement.

Company enforces tools that restricts creativity and freedom when selling. I.e. You must fill out paperwork when selling a computer and ask questions straight from the paper. 

Copy Center is the worse department to work in if you get stuck over there. The company does not offer good enough training for new associates. The tools they give copy center could be better. Machines break or have issues that cannot be solved in house. You have to deal with upset customers everyday. 

Tech Depot services changes too often. Again, unnecessary paperwork has to be filled out as well as PC Tune up scans. The PC Tune up scans are fake by the way. They use it to enhance the ""experience"" of the selling process. If you're skilled and intelligent enough to explain to a customer their issues and the solution for it, it's an insult to you to have to run such software on the computers. 

Turn around rate can be high. Associates are not paid enough for the work they do. 

No overtime.

Lowered our commission rate.] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: Weatherford International promotes international travel depending on the product line, to some very interesting places like Brazil, Singapore, USA, Poland to name a few.
cons: Certain field employees do not receive holiday pay due to an outdated rolled up holiday policy.

Although Weatherford offers relocation assistance for new assignments, it appears local management try to get away with helping as little as possible.  Be sure to make sure you have the right information from the begining - Is it a permenant/temporary position - Is there a job at the end of it - will there be help with repatriation - Review the official company policy.  

From personal and witnessing experiences, holidays are not approved until the last minute and on occassions due to poor planning and management, have been denied the day before a holiday was due to start.

While I appreciate that Weatherford is a service company, Weatherford management need to appreciate that the services are provided by human beings and not robots.  It is not possible for people to work 24/7/365.  People need to rest and recover, returning from a job at 5AM and to be told to be at work by mid-day does not provide employees time for rest (just one example of a recent occurance, not to me I might add....).] =",terrible,bad,excellent

[pros: Rue21 has a fun store atmosphere. When management reflects that positivity you can have a really good time while learning the industry. I learned a lot about retail and continued to make myself a better associate, which brings me to my next pro. Rue21 offers promotions to its current workers. I was offered a shift manager position after only 6 months of being there. The store worked around my full time class schedule which helped me out a lot. After being there for 2 years I was offered the full time store Assistant Manager position. I could not take that position even though I wanted it because I was a full time college student. 
Sometimes the store would have store vs. store competitions which were fun and other competitions where prizes were involved for meeting sales goals. 
You learn style. You get to dress up outfits all over the store. You can add your own personal touch to them and you get an employee discount. The discount isn't that great...about 10% but they have these employee appreciation events and they are amazing. You get 50% off everything. During a specified night you go after store hours to mingle and try on outfits. 
Since the job isn't your typical 8-5pm work schedule, you can be flexible with it. This leaves your schedule more open to doctor appointments and other weekday events. 
Your moving around. Granted you need to wear comfortable shoes because your on your feet all day. But it beats sitting at a desk all day in front of a computer screen.
cons: If your a store manager the hours can be brutal. I remember that at times they were required to work at least one 1-10pm shift a week. They get an hour break but that's still a really long day. It is hard not to get burned out during that kind of shift. The typical day in a rue21 store is usually very busy. If your not helping customers you are performing store duties and most of the time your doing that at the same time. If your store doesn't have a good team this makes the work life really stressful. Sometimes you have to work a holiday. Nobody likes to work holidays but rue21 is open for all holidays, except christmas. Unless you have an agreement with the store manager that you cannot work weekends, expect to work them. Weekends are busiest for rue21.] =",good,good,good

The sexual assault for women is outrageous and people come home with illnesses they can't get rid of. You often find yourself bored. Waste of time in hinde sight.

[pros: If I say ""not a thing"", does that count towards the word count? It should. Because... I hated it.
cons: I've never worked in a place that looked down on certain employees with such disgrace. I worked their for nearly six years and was consistently belittled, and had it constantly made known I wasn't worth much. In the six years I worked there, my pay went up, in total, a little over $1 an hour. (That was partially when it was still MeritCare as well). Upper management does not give two shits about employees who make the place function. After going to HR about a serious issue and policy violation absolutely nothing was done about it other than a firm finger pointing and me then being treated even more unfairly because of reporting it. I have never worked in a more racist and sexist place in my life.

Unlike other pharmaceutical companies, Lilly tends to be more conservative and stable in its business policies, so they do not have the wide fluctuations in number of sales reps seen in other companies.

[pros: Obviously, the name recognition is important for launching your career.  There are many areas to gain general experience while trying to decide which path you would like to take within the company.  The trainings they have set-up for employees, from new hires to partners, is outstanding.  They make sure that everyone is extremely knowledgable.  You have the opportunity to travel for work and for training to various places around the country, while staying in 4 star hotels and eating at the finest restauratnts in each city.  Because the company is so large, it's easy to develop a network of friends.
cons: The number one downside to working at PwC is the work-life balance.  I understand the need to pay your dues, but when you work 80+ hours/week during busy season for 6+ months out of the year, you would at least like a bonus or some words of praise.  Management expects a lot out of employees, but is not willing to give or be understanding of employees' needs.  PwC makes a big deal out of the whole ""work-life balance"" idea, but that's just lip service.  Sure, they give you the opportunity to take time off and work 4 tens during offseasons.  However, nobody really is able to take advantage of those opportunities, and PTO goes unused.  I guess that makes up for the lack of bonuses.] =",neutral,bad,good

[pros: - You get to work with great people.
- You will learn how to market content for a wide variety of clients.
- Senior staff is typically very helpful with all components of the job.
- It can be a great feeling to help clients grow their businesses through a wide variety of ways. 
- The CEO does a great job of communicating through email and during in-person meetings every Friday.
cons: - Unrealistic goals are put on the entire content team. This is paired with the unspoken expectation that hitting the goal isn't simply enough and in order to ""execute excellence"" you should be exceeding that goal. Hitting the goals that are set for the team is more often than not is reflected in the quality of the content that is being produced for the clients that Madwire takes on. With a marketing company, you should expect quality over quantity, and that simply isn't something that Madwire seems to value. 
- Unlimited PTO gives Madwire the excuse to work employees harder than they should resulting in burnout. If you want to even take a couple of days off for vacation then be prepared to work longer hours and weekends to hit your goal. For a company that claims to care about work-life balance, they don't do a great job of showing it. 
- Change is constant which makes it pretty hard to get in a solid workflow for more than a week. This isn't always a bad thing because sometimes the changes can be positive, but oftentimes they are rolled out in such quick fashion that it ends up adding more to the stress and workload of the department as a whole. 
- You will be expected to market to a large variety of clients even if that client is blatantly racist or homophobic. The clients shouldn't be expected to hold the same values as Madwire does, but a diverse marketing staff should not have to market a company that would not want them to come into that business because of their gender, ethnicity, or identity either. 
- The company is growing quickly which is good, but at the cost of growth comes benefits, salary, and a feeling of having a steady job.] =",good,bad,excellent

[pros: Archstone really went above and beyond in employee selection.  On top of extensive interviews with community managers, the online pre-hire screening was very thorough.  Therefore, the employees that you end up working with are all cut from the same mold, which meant by and large, everyone got along very well!  On top of the pre-employment selection process, the training given once employed was equally thorough and you were encouraged and rewarded to ask questions until you really understood the processes, brand, culture, and resources available to you and your community's residents.
cons: Company was acquired by its two biggest competitors in the early part of 2013, so immediately most long-time and even shorter tenure employees knew that the incoming ownership, which was Equity Residential and Avalon Bay, might have a culture and benefits clash with the old way of doing things.

[pros: Great benefits, health insurance is fully covered and you have access to a Teacher Retirement retirement fund. I have very mixed feelings about this position because some of the work is great and I really enjoyed the impact I could have, but your experience very much depends on WHICH department you work in at UT. Each one is completely different. I've worked in other areas of UT before where people were perfectly lovely and helpful. In this position, I enjoyed being able to do my job, when I was actually allowed to perform my assigned job duties, and not having to cover a million other, unfilled job positions. However, actually getting to do the job I was hired to do was a very rare coincidence. When someone hired to be a writer is forced to do accounting because they won't hire an accounts person, you know something's not right.
cons: In a nutshell, there is no organizational structure, efficiency, the programs they use are seriously outdated (40 years old in fact), management is completely unreceptive to feedback and not supportive, and the work environment is passive aggressive and at times, toxic. 

I have a lot of grievances regarding this position. Primarily, that I was responsible for the workload of several employees, and that the department refused to hire more employees while I was there. After I left, they had to hire four full time employees to cover my workload. A workload that I completed without any assistance. Even though I consistently requested help during my tenure there, I was told they would not hire anyone else, and I received very little support or understanding from management. 

Overall, in the department I was under, chaos reigned and faculty ruled all. Even if a faculty member had no experience or background in your field of expertise (AKA the reason you were hired in the first place) what they say goes, no matter what. Even if it's against best practices in your field or what your own research shows. There was also a TON of micromanagement and passive aggressiveness in the workplace. In my experience, no one was willing to discuss any issues or try to resolve conflict one on one first. Instead, they immediately reported any issue to management, and were quick to cc you on emails that created scapegoats, threw you under the bus, or blamed someone else to save their own skin, even if their accusations were completely unfounded or untrue. Often the focus was more on placing the blame than on finding a solution. They would immediately make a note in your record, so they could have grounds to fire you later on. Since UT is a government agency, it is incredibly difficult to get fired from, often taking years of documented evidence to remove an employee. As such, everyone keeps notes about other employees and exactly what they ""do wrong"" at exactly what time so if they need that information at a later date they have it. This created an atmosphere of paranoia, mistrust, and again, passive aggressiveness. 

The turnover rate in our department was also crazy-high. They had been through nearly 10 employees in a few years and were unable to retain anyone for more than an average of about 1.5 years. Many people cited the unmanageable workload as a reason for leaving. 

Salary information was also accessible to every employee, and, as one of the higher-paid employees in the department, really impacted the way others treated me. 

I was also constantly reminded that I was only a staff member, not a faculty member, and that faculty members were more important than me.  I was told that, since I was just a staff member, I shouldn't be allowed to feel upset if faculty and others ignored a closed office door and just barged right in without knocking, even if it disrupted phone calls with important donors. That was just one of many examples where I was told by my boss, and I quote, that ""I should just learn to keep my mouth shut and do what I'm told."" Even though I was hired for a position that requires interviewing, creativity and thinking outside the box. My boss (a faculty member) was actually notorious for making the students he advised cry. 

There was very little, if any organizational structure. The blatant inefficiencies that disrupt productivity were truly astonishing, and many of my coworkers used seriously outdated methods and were not open to change of any kind. As a whole, UT uses an accounting system, called Define, that is nearly 40 years old and still uses the forward delete key, on a black screen where you have to physically type in different command function keys. The cons of this position, the lack of caring on the part of management, and the toll to my physical health that doing the work of so many people for years took are all the reasons why I decided to quit this position. It just wasn't worth it anymore. 

If you can find a good department with supportive, caring people, and a staff member as your boss which allows you to have little interaction with faculty in the workplace, then UT can be a great place to work. Unfortunately, the cons outweighed the pros for me.] =",bad,terrible,good
