[pros: Westat conducts high-quality work that benefits our society is done here by knowledgeable, professional staff.  The company offers good working conditions (most professional staff have their own offices, not cubicles or shared offices), solid benefits, and treats its staff with respect.  The research work done at Westat is primarily done for agencies of the Federal Government.  You can work here and feel good about giving policymakers sound, accurate data on which to base policy decisions.  Westat is supportive of ongoing staff training and also has a tuition reimbursement benefit.  The company also offers free, internal classes to beef up your computer skills.
cons: Increases in work responsibility tend to precede increases in compensation.  Rather than getting a clear-cut promotion, Westat often just modifies your role without increasing your salary.  So you basically work at a more advanced job for a year or more before finding out to what extent your salary will be adjusted to compensate you for your new role.  There is an ebb and flow to the workflow--sometimes steady periods of work are punctuated with extremely busy periods or very slow periods.  The company has not been receptive to allowing salaried employees to telecommute on a regular basis, even if their work could easily be conducted offsite.] =",good,good,excellent

[pros: If you like being lied too, treated like cattle, don't want or have a life away from work. Well this company is for you!
cons: There truck driving school is nothing but a joke. I was there for a total of 14 days. Out of the 14 days only 3 days was spent behind the wheel. And out of the 3 days about two and a half hours was actual drive time. You spend most of your time in a class room learning very little about drive a truck. Most of your time is spent on learning C.R. Englands policies, how great it is working of them and how much money you can make. What they convently leave out is; C.R. England is the laughing stock of the trucking industry just ask any truck driver at the nearest truck stop. The amount of money they tell you will make is true but not with C.R. England. C.R. England pay is the lowest in the indusrty. Oh, when they say were a family orientated company; what they are referring to is there family not yours. 
   Now after you ""graduate"" there wonderful trucking school you move on OTR training. Which is nothing but a joke. Most if not all of the driver trainers themselves have less than a year driving experence. Second your paid minimum wage about 450 a week. If you were getting paid by the mile it would average out to 1700 a week or more depending on the miles. C.R. England is making a killing off there student drivers. 
  Now that all of your ""training"" is done you get dropped off in Salt Lake City not have a clue who to talk to were to go, etc.. Here you retake test that you possible failed, pick if you want to be a solo or team driver. And recieve a phone call from a DM offering you a job.

Good office fit-outs
Good coffee

If you need stable income and accept status quo then resmed can be your place (until retrenched - which does happen very silently)

CEO / board does strategic decisions on what market desires. However implemention is not clear.
Top is very heavy (70 or so VPs!). 
Lower level is crushed. No room for growth. 
Nepotism, bureaucracy, favoritism is rife. Few key top people make decision without accountability.
How can one go from technical to VP in 2-3 years is beyond comprehension - religion, church, language is rewarded well.

[pros: Chick-fil-a has a great work atmosphere. The fellow employees are usually nice people, and the managers are really great and patient when you need them. Most everyone has a high work ethic and want to do good at their job. Also, most people outside of high school have a good chance of promotion around 1-2 years of service. You also have many opportunities to work in different positions, such as drive-thru, registers, dinning room (cleanliness and hospitality) and kitchen.
cons: Most employees are very young (<17) and have little or no experience working; this can make working with them frustrating at times. Communication skills are essential for this job, and some people lack them, which can cause miscommunications between kitchen and front, and awkward guests interactions. A lot of time is expected from this company; it is okay to ask off when needed, but management will look down upon you if you ask off too much. The morals of the company are pretty high, and if you break Christian taboos or disagree with some of their ethics, this may not be the place for you.] =",neutral,good,excellent

[pros: None for this company. I am greatful to this website though. Warning others is the best I can do right now.
cons: If you want a promotion you had better be male. Our district had 32 manager positions including general managers. 9 female assistant managers, no female general managers. A company fully aware of its district, general managers inappropriate behavior yet did nothing when complaints were filed.

Sure they have policies written down in a book for legal purposes. However, the general manager was allowed to change stores to a different region(replaced by a male). The district manager retired. The employees harassed were not acknowledged other than termination. Lawsuit with EEOC still pending, OSI still denying.  They even drug their feet on verifying my termination so I could receive unemployment benefits.(healthcare,etc.)

Dont do the 401k and need to withdraw it. This crack squad will sit on your request for months, literally.  

Corporate leadership changed recently, zero improvement. Congratulations to the $5 billion dollar a year monster that runs freely over its employees without having to own up to their actions.

[pros: Excellent pay and benefits.  Fairly good control over day to day work within performance objectives which were pretty much given to you with limited opportunity to adjust. Some goals were not realistic to achieve but were downward driven
cons: Sometimes a dreary work atmosphere with too much backbiting and misfits who could be out to get you for no apparent reason.  Majority of coworkers were either active or former military so you have to be able to live in that atmosphere which could be rather stiff and suffocating at times.

- A lot of talk from upper management but no action, never translated down to employee level.

[pros: CEO is a good person along with amazing perspective towards business.
If you have the urge and the passion, you can pick up any task in the company and deliver it. There are good chances of exposure and growth if you work for it.
Depending on your team and managers, you can have a good work life balance.
cons: There is no central body within the company who can help you with your issues within the team or company.
If you have issues with your manager, you cannot go to anyone for a solution or try and switch to another departments. So mostly people quit in such cases.
Ideally, HR team should be handling such cases, but the HR team in Zoomcar is more of an admin kind of team, where they just handle small things like small events within company, and scheduling interviews. HR does not think from people's perspective or for people. People have had bad experiences with HR.
There is a lot of friction within the company across various departments. Everyone works in their own way and a lot of tiff keeps happening amongst leads.
Promotions or hikes are way less than the market as it is dependent less on the performance and more on your personal relationships, internal politics, as well as how badly they want to retain you.] =",terrible,neutral,bad

[pros: The benefit of being able to check out the pre-released books are always fun. always great to see what is coming out before it is edited. 
the coffee actually tastes pretty good.
cons: The management could use some tuning as far as how to run the store, However, that could be blamed on the General Manager for not really doing their job correctly, or having too many ""friends"" in the company that can be used to get their way by means of ""getting rid of people"". Notice the air quotes... 

the company itself is relying too heavily on pushing the membership and magazine subscriptions.

[pros: -Styling customers was great, getting to sell to frequent clients and build relationships with them came very easily 
-About four times a year, we would receive 75% off of 4 items, BUT these could not all be the same type of clothing (i.e. can't buy four shirts, instead two tops and two bottoms) and no accessories
cons: -Went through FIVE different managers the whole two years I worked there. People (especially managers) can't seem to get out of there fast enough and frequently managers would change schedules with one day notice's
-Pretty low pay (minimum wage) and zero commission, a serious bummer when you sell $3000+ in one shift
-Depending on the manager, the dress code is pretty ridiculous. Everything you are expected to wear is preferably currently full-price items, and if they are a color other than black white grey or nude and they are not full price you can never wear them again to work. Patterns can only be worn on Fridays and when the pattern is currently full-price on the floor. Basically they want you to spend what little money you make on new clothes for work.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: - Some coworkers make work enjoyable - Sometimes there are free snacks - Meeting people that become your friends - Discounts range from 40% to 75% - Discounts on group workouts or at yoga/pilate studios
cons: - Low pay which doesn’t correspond to the physical labor and long hours inputted. You are better off working for Amazon and receiving higher wages. - Short breaks which range from 10-30 minutes. - Managers/Coworkers can be nosy and annoying - Rude and entitled guests come into any establishment. However, lululemon enables that behavior from those kind of people. They have a strange policy of “saying yes to the guest” no matter how crazy the requests seem. - Micromanagement from some managers. They take their stress out on the educators because they don’t know how to properly lead. No one is ever on the same page because some managers make changes without a warning. To avoid doing their job, they will give out “tasks” while they sit around and talk about you or other coworkers. - Fake positivity is constantly pushed by management. People have lives outside of their job and everyday isn’t always a good day. - False promises of rewards are proposed by management to persuade people to come work outside of business hours.] =",neutral,terrible,bad

[pros: The pay is very competitive compared to other banks.
cons: The IC plan has gotten more and more confusing which makes it harder for people to understand how they get their bonus pay. After working 100% in person through a pandemic, there was no relief when it came to sales in the tough sales environment we were in (with interest rates being terrible and people wanting to avoid risk). A lot of the upper management who have the luxury of working from home are so disconnected on what actually goes on day to day in the branches and the demands are pretty high. As a branch manager you are consistently being stretched so thin which take a toll on work life balance. As a result they would do things like ‘pizza day’ or ‘jeans Friday’ which is a little bit of a joke. When I first started 5 years ago, I thought it was a great place to work for but I have seen the decline throughout the years and many many many people who have been with the company for a long time are now leaving. Also, after trying to get out of retail for my mental health— other internal job opportunities were hard to even get an interview with. Which seems crazy because I worked there for 5 years. I would just get an automatic email saying ‘we went with another candidate’ without a person even reaching out to me. So disheartening— as I am a HARD worker who is capable or learning anything and everything. This was ultimately the last straw for me.] =",good,good,bad

[pros: I work at Verizon's San Jose office (OnCue division). We used to be an independent start-up within Intel, called Intel Media, and then we got acquired by VZ, and the whole work experience went down the drain. All decisions--engineering, marketing, product--are now made by typical corporate warriors in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, with minimal innovation or attention to employees in Silicon Valley. Top executives managing VZ's Silicon Valley office all come from 15+ year corporate careers within VZ. If you are an engineer in Silicon Valley looking to change the world, would you be happy working for a company where--literally--all the shots are called by 15+ year corporate warriors in New Jersey? I doubt it. 

Also, when you join VZ, they give you all the typical corporate line, like you'll have a great career here. Yeah right. Corporate management in New Jersey does not care about employee development in the San Jose office. If you have a personal development goal, or if you want management to help you with any personal work issues, you will NOT get any support from management in New Jersey. To them, you are just another cog in the wheel, and they only care about their own corporate careers (remember, ALL managers VP and above have been with VZ for 15+ years, and these people only care about their own careers). 

The Silicon Valley office tries to do some innovation, and I appreciate OnCue executives' (original Intel Media execs, who are now all gone) efforts at innovating. However, the corporate politics is deep, and all innovation takes a back seat to corporate politics, and development delays are not uncommon due to corporate politics. 

If you are an engineer looking to change the world, or are looking to join a dynamic tech company, then skip Verizon's San Jose office. This place is only good for people who are satisfied being cogs in the corporate machine, or who just want job security. If you are an innovator, look elsewhere. If you are a young engineer, STEER CLEAR of Verizon's San Jose office... this is not a place for young people (imagine working out of Verizon's corporate office in New Jersey, that's what this feels like). Plenty of other options in Silicon Valley.
cons: Verizon's Silicon Valley office is a glorified assembly line for VZ executives in New Jersey. You are told what to build by executives who've never worked in a real tech company, and who frankly don't give a damn about any rank-and-file employee in San Jose.

As an example of poor culture in the San Jose office, as of 2015, only 2 of the original 10 Intel Media executives remain. All the rest have either been pushed out by Verizon or got fed up with Verizon and left. Lunch time conversations with rank-and-file employees almost ALWAYS touch on how horrible Verizon's culture is compared to what we had at Intel. It's actually funny seeing how much the average OnCue employee dislikes Verizon's corporate culture. As of 2015, almost everyone I spoke to who came from Intel has told me they are looking for new jobs on the side (especially the most talented ones). To many here, Verizon is more a steady pay check than a place to develop one's career in Silicon Valley. 

All-in-all, the cultural clash going from a 300-person start-up at Intel into corporate Verizon did NOT go well--primarily because Verizon came in and wiped clean the original Intel Media executive team, and installed their own VPs in black suits from New Jersey to run OnCue. Absolutely terrible cultural integration.] =",neutral,terrible,none

cons: While I am sure there is a strategy it was never communicated in enough detail to give you confidence that the business knew where it was going.  It would appear that the company is betting the farm on a single new offering and running the business as a body shop.  There is no budget for training or travel so when offices close it's hard to get face to face time with any of your team.  Very little transparency, no upfront acknowledgement that the company may have problems.  When the company announces full year figures and the CEO fails to relay the figures in his communication, you know there's something wrong (company loses 33% of it's value).  There are some great leaders but they're too little too late and lack the power or resources to make any change.  I would suggest using Ciber as a short term option before moving on to a bigger, stronger consultancy.] =",neutral,neutral,bad

[pros: Most of the people I work with a great and make work fun. Again, most of my managers are amazing and make me look forward to work (as much as you can look forward to a job). My managers constantly recognize my hard work and it feels good that they do. Interacting with the friendly pet parents and the cute animals is definitely a perk. You're required a 15 minute break every 2 hours and a 30 minute lunch after 4. They're great at making sure you get every break you're owed.
cons: If you work on the register for a full day, 8 hours standing (minus lunch/breaks) can suck really bad. Wear COMFORTABLE shoes, trust me, it's way more important than wearing something cute/cool. A dog will probably eventually pee on them anyways... and I'm only sort of kidding about that. The only other downfall I can think of is having to deal with very rude customers who want to use expired coupons/deals or just have a bad attitude, and cleaning up after people who don't use the pet mess cleanup stations we have around the store.] =",neutral,excellent,bad

[pros: Not a lot of pros, there's almost always something to do so you're being productive. One of the best things about this job is the co-workers and getting to hangout.
cons: Low pay, there is no room to advance so if you want a job that you can grow with that won't happen. Associates such as myself get used by department leads and managers to do their jobs so they don't have to- they will claim they are too busy doing other stuff and ask you to do it but then they take 10 minute smoke breaks every hour. Managers act like children and will be rude to you, knowing you're not allowed to say anything back. The customers are rude and entitled, again not allowed to say anything back. The worst thing about this job is hands down the fact that I do the same thing as managers- run down aisles (FOR THEM), do markdowns, etc etc etc etc... but I only get paid 7.39 after over a year of working there and many times getting employee of the month. They do not appreciate employees at all. If you're a favorite of theirs you're allowed to do whatever you want of course.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Pharma has money- the pay is comparable to prior on-site positions with quarterly merit based bonuses available though that is now changing to a yearly bonus in 2023.
cons: They are eliminating our position April 2023 & we were informed via a town hall Teams meeting with all attendee mics muted and the chat turned off. Of course just a week prior they implemented a transfer freeze until February. Honestly, it’s the most strategy I’ve seen at this company. They hired new employees a few months ago and since their position is being eliminated that means they won’t have worked there for a year so they are being told to reimburse the company for all RN licensing fees the company had paid for. This can be in the thousands!! On LinkedIn they admire themselves for having a Lean team. Really- there is not an inkling of process improvement for the nurse educator. It is ridiculous how we are told to document and set tasks for reimbursement employees and they are never addressed. Never! Until you add it to an Escalation log 7-10 days later, while the patient just waits and waits. There are too many areas for improvement to even start listing them. The pay is not worth it at this point & now they’ve implemented Calabrio that will monitor our every call and action. This place was bad before that- don’t offer suggestions because they aren’t listening. If “the client” wants a change in workflow it is implemented immediately with severe delays in updating job aids and SOPs leading to ongoing confusion amongst the nurses. This place treats nurses so poorly, we are heard and treated as though we don’t know what we are doing. They create the confusion! Then there is the weekly team meeting where they address some relevant material, but skip right over the true issues at hand. Do not expect to be acknowledged for how awesome you are- because you are. It takes expertise to handle and care for patients that are being provided subpar care due to lack of efficiency and tasks being completely ignored!] =",neutral,bad,terrible

[pros: Flexible work schedule. Nice colleagues.
cons: As you soon as you start working for PPS you realize how unhappy people there are. Staff are stressed and tired. The staff turnover is high. Leadership does not know what they are doing and cannot make decisions. Feels like working for an organization in the 90s, old school, rigid, hierarchical and breeds culture of favoritism and secrecy. HR policies not consistently applied and no consequences of unethical work practices. Not much career growth except for those who are 'liked' by the CEO or Leadership. Access to opportunities, growth and even salary raises is not equitable.  PPS is not a diverse organization. There are some improvements as they are trying to hire people from different cultures and backgrounds, but struggle being inclusive. There are a lot of women in the organization and in the management, but leadership does put genuine effort to support and promote people from other backgrounds. Leadership is all white. They have not yet figured out consistent and equitable hybrid working policy too, very slow moving. They need to learn how to practice what they preach to federal government.] =",neutral,bad,bad

[pros: Company management is very hands on to help you succeed.  They take the time to consistently train us and ensure we are doing everything possible to be successful.  Team oriented environment where everyone helps each other on deals too. Just came back from company event in Palm Springs and had a blast.  One of the biggest pros for this company is the marketing and leads they provide.  I used to cold call in my other position and lets just say its a lot different when there is marketing.  Also, they offer a salary on top of commissions.  many jobs with similar companies are only given draws on future commissions.

[pros: They were the first to call me back when I was laid off
cons: After I came out in 2016, I endured years of attempts to force me out of my job. There were and are flagrant OSHA and ADA violations, constant abuse and sexual harassment from customers, and victim blaming and transphobia from multiple managers at multiple levels. They employ someone who’s sexually harassed me at another position, as well as an admitted child abuser who has no problem telling stories. As if that weren’t bad enough, management lied to my face, inventing a reason to write me up counter to recorded evidence, in yet another attempt to get rid of me. Widespread constant tech issues, horrible facilities, a restrictive and discriminatory dress code, and corporate training seminars featuring violent imagery, blamed, of course, on the victim. There’s an acknowledged effort to change hours, seating, and supervisors constantly in order to prevent employee fraud rings, but with the stringent background checks, it’s pretty obvious that this effort is actual union busting, especially since any union’s first act would be to call a massive strike.

[pros: Great brands and beautiful HQ facility.
cons: Where do I begin? Managers promoted to incompetence.  Very High Turnover especially for women.  (HR needs to look at that.)  Anyone over 50 should start looking because Campbell likes to fire and hire two Millenials.  Then the Millennials quit.  Nice strategy.        Before I left I heard from others that had left that Campbells was the worst company they ever worked for.

[pros: Flexible working is very good in my experience
Plenty of opportunities to try new career paths 
Good for building an entry level career, lots of exposure to novel technology
cons: Too many to mention but here's a short list (in no particular order):
Senior leaders have managed to create a fear culture that permeates most of the company. You can see this most in governance interactions, which are more like a Victorian schoolroom rather than an environment where all viewpoints are valued. The AZ values are quite a decent framework of behaviour that all employees should follow. Unfortunately these values seem to be for underlings only, don't expect them to be displayed by senior leaders in the majority of cases.
Workload in many functions is quite frankly ridiculous. If you don't work on evenings and weekends you apparently aren't performing your role effectively.
I've worked for many companies over two decades and I have to say that the frequency of individuals with massive egos is by far the most I've seen. This makes doing your day job all that more difficult. To be fair there are some great people too (all suffering).
ZERO pension contributions from the company (you have to contribute it all yourself). Bonus is calculated on a lower 'base salary' value and not on what you would consider your normal salary.
Performance review process is onerous and it can and will be used to unfairly beat you with by certain managers (usually those with the massive egos).
Turnover of staff is unmanageable, the 'revolving door' just won't stop. This adds to workload, reduces project knowledge and makes resourcing almost impossible.
The lack of process is astonishing. Good if you are a free thinking spirit who likes to make it up as you go along but bad if you need to learn the job and work in a highly regulated environment.] =",bad,terrible,terrible

Now learning outcomes are mandated by a patchwork of statutory, field-requested and command-directed standards.

Every member of the UDR associate community is encouraged and expected to participate in the success of the company.  UDR is also very proactive about engaging the customer and asking for their opinions through many interactive tools and surveys.  UDR believes in asking for feedback and using this information to build a stronger and better business.  Lastly UDR believes in growing from within.  They have a rigorous training program and are constantly adding new ways to grow the skill sets of the employee.  When new positions open UDR always takes a look at their current employees first for those opportunities.   This gives the associates a feeling that they have room to grow in the company and the tools they need to get the skills required for the next level.

[pros: Great benefits with generous PTO banks. Bonus is still good, used to be better. The work is pretty straight forward and their training program is designed for you to succeed if you work at it.
cons: The work environment is toxic. Call centers leave something to be desired, but this is next level. Floor managers hold people back from promoting if you don't fit their mold. Mid management is a little clique that act like high schoolers.] =",excellent,good,bad

[pros: Great people to work with. In team working relationships are great. Cross functional relationships are a bit more difficult.

[pros: If you love talking about videogames, this is a good place to go. People basically come in and ask you for advice on what game to pick out. Being able to checkout videogames is also really great so that you get a wide variety of gaming knowledge under your belt. Discount is pretty fair, it'll really help shave the dollars off of your next purchase.
cons: Management did not communicate with Game Advisors very well. Sometimes a lot of details about sales and major trade-in deals get left out because they expect the information to eventually leak down from Key Holders to Game Advisors. There's A LOT of room to mess up, from filling out pawn slips to forgetting to say one single word in a phone greeting, so it can be a stressful job to remember everything. Upper management was not nearly as bad as local management, as mine was particularly moody and prone to being sarcastic and snarky. Having to sell the subscriptions and reservations is also a major stress point, especially if you haven't exactly developed the right way to sell things. The pay is also fairly horrible.] =",neutral,bad,bad

[pros: Training and technology have improved over the years. Company has gotten more organized and proactive to give stores a more effective way of running a business successfully. Never a dull moment, day moves quickly with the amount of tasks given. With the right team, it can be a fun atmosphere to be in.
cons: Zero competitive pay. Compensation is on the low end compared to other retailers. If you are big on visual standards and presentation, this is not the company for you. Stores are extremely cluttered, tables are packed with flimsy shirts that look unappealing when folded. It is a discount store so the kind of clientele that walks in isn't the greatest and will not care to mess up anything you worked so hard to set up. Company seems to not care how a store is presented rather focusing on making sure you honor anything a customer asks of you, ridiculous as it may be and assuring your hitting your fragrance percentages. Overall if you can get past that, you will be fine. Building a strong, capable team is what is going to lead you to success and longevity with this company, otherwise it will be challenging and not worth it.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: Highly respected in industry. Good Asset on Resume. I personally liked working there because of the team I was on. This was one of their top stores.
cons: Like all retail raises if any are miniscule. I was let go because of pandemic. I was supposed to be called back but despite being one of stores top performers I was let go because of my age. Hiring used to be done by the individual stores but now it has been turned over to a 3rd party. I reapplied when things got better and they said it was nice gettiing to know you but were going to pass on hiring you The store manager wanted me back but the 3rd party group blocked that.

[pros: You will have the opportunity to have a positive impact with many families at a very difficult time in their lives.
cons: This company is so hyper focused on metrics and pleasing the shareholders that many decisions are made without considering the human element. Staff here are generally unhappy and most feel over worked as each location tries to operate with the least amount of staff possible to maximize profits. The result is that most locations are understaffed to serve every family to the best of our ability. Every market has its own nuances, but nobody seems to be able to make their own decisions without sending a request all the way up the chain to Houston. Because of this, it takes forever to get anything done, and often decisions are made considering the company as a whole and not what's best for each market. The pay structures are convoluted and over complicated, and in order to maximize your income you will be required to focus on hitting key metrics routinely and upselling vulnerable families.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: Management is so ignorant that you can literally get away with whatever you want! aka shopping during your shift, trying stuff on whenever you want, taking extra breaks, rolling joints in the bathroom
cons: Staff is taken advantage of ALL THE TIME. Management becomes friends with certain staff members and they get special treatment. Managers overlook everyone's hours in the computer and then can adjust your punches so you get paid less and never tell you. There is no sense of unity, anyone will throw anyone under the bus - even if they're your supposed right hand man. The entire corporation is running on mindless brains that don't know how to run such a huge conglomerate. Everything from standards to the way shipment is received to the handwriting pen-and-paper way of closing a store that makes over $30g / weekend. In 2014 who should be counting bank deposits of over $5000 BY HAND???  People were sexually harassed all the time and nothing was done about it. No one was ever fired even if they rightfully deserved to be let go. Corporate is dumb too. I don't know how those people get hired. Unrealistic deadlines all the time.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: It's a job. You like it or not but it is a job. $10-$12 /hr.

Friendly Co-workers

Free Uniforms ( a lot of them were worn by other people, before you.)
cons: Believe me! You don't want to work for Guardsmark. (Unless you are really desperate)

Hiring Process: The process is long and you are required to complete 40 pages application, pass background check, polygraph test, answered 500 totally useless questions, get six references from your neighbors (including addresses and phone numbers), bring HS. diploma with transcript and then......Yes, you will get a job for $10/hr. (nice!)

Benefits: The package with benefits offered to all full time employees by Guardsmark can be described in one simple word: GARBAGE. With that ""medical insurance"" you cannot do too much. For most of your medical services, you need to pay on your own. 

Tuition Assistance: You might hear some promises from hiring manager about getting money for school offered by Guardsmark. Well, you need to take classes related to the business (security, criminal justice) if you have a different major, just forget about it. The tuition assistance for school is up to $1000 per school year. ( it is a joke not a help for working students)

Monthly training sheet : this is hilarious! Each month, all officers are required to complete training regarding safety rules, existing hazards, procedures etc. However , this is not hands on training! They give you a reading material and your job is to read and rewrite the same info on the provided form. They also ask you to lie, that you have completed a few hours of training on your form but in reality you finish this ""training"" in 15 minutes. But the goal is to make the bosses happy. (right?)

 Vacation: After one year, all full time employees are eligible to receive 1 week paid vacation. The problem is that with Guardsmark, you can't even pick your own dates for vacation. They have some excuses like: ""oh you can't take your vacation now, because........ thousands of reasons appear"" 

Paycheck / Salary raise : With Guardsmark, you receive paper check (sure, why not! who needs direct deposit in 2012?) every two weeks.  In addition to that, you also receive a Guardsmark's newspaper which is LOADED with more and more Propaganda describing the company as the best in the business, very professional etc. ( of course, the reality is quite different) 
Forget about raises with this Company! After one year , you can expect a raise of few cents. (That's it!)

there are more interesting things to say about ""the best company"" in the business, but I think that the info you just read above is good enough to avoid working for them.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: Excellent benefits, competitive salary, and great opportunities to move up and develop professionally. The company really prioritizes succession planning and the movement of their employees. It's also a flexible company in many ways - while your work schedule fluctuates regularly, working on the weekend gives you the opportunity to change your day off when necessary, or arrange your schedule to have a 4 day weekend. Target also takes very seriously its anti-discrimination and zero-tolerance harassment policies. Everyone's concerns are taken seriously for the most part, from the Cart Attendant to the Store Team Leader.
cons: While ETL schedules do have some uniformity to it (every other weekend, and one day off mid week), working 6 days straight in a retail environment, 10+ hours a day is extremely exhausting. Holiday work/life balance is unfortunately at this point, non-existent. (Think, arriving at 9pm on Thanksgiving, and leaving at 9am Black Friday).  Developing professionally with Target is a big focus, with a lot of opportunities to do so, but it too requires what's called ""Doing more."" That means the 50 hour work week minimum is just that - a minimum. If you have a desire to be recognized or to promote, there are almost unlimited work hours in the week at your disposal to do go above and beyond, and since going above and beyond is expected for developing professionals, it almost inevitably means any work/life balance disappears. As a District Resource (an additional title that allowed me to ""do more"" as I prepared for a promotion) I worked 70 hours/week more times than I'd like to admit, just to meet expectations (existing job requirements and my assigned side projects). Even with the competitive bonuses and raises I've received with Target, calculating my hourly wage by the number of hours I work is always depressing.

Target's corporate direction has also been through so much change in the past 5 years, between entering/exiting Canada, and the security breach. Brian Cornell seems to be making the right changes, but the volume of changes necessary has been overwhelming for stores. Each week or month, there is inevitably a new roll out, requiring more training and less payroll. Everyone is feeling the strain, and even in the best stores, I've seen the managerial environment to be exhausted, overworked, and rather cynical. Target is changing so quickly, and there is not yet an equilibrium between new expectations and old.

Lastly, much of the store experience relies heavily on the Store Team Leader (STL). As his/her only peer in the building, your STL's management style is the determining factor for the tone, the accountability, the effectiveness and overall morale of the store. As someone who has had an extremely erratic, disrespectful and disorganized STL, as well as an excellent, empowering STL, this can be a both good and bad thing. But, since no one has a say in choosing their own boss, there is no way to predict what your situation will be, or how effectively you will be able to perform your job. Your STL's performance (and therefore your store's) is almost exclusively determined by the perception of the District Team Leader (DTL), and that can be influenced by a number of things - personal likes/dislikes, frequency of district visits, and payroll performance. It can prove a very discouraging environment, even in a fantastic store.] =",good,excellent,excellent

[pros: Unisys is a good place for someone that will have the time to learn. lot's of training material available online for those who want to expand their knowledge. lot's of material on the internal web sites. lot's of programs to explore. But Managers will not give you the time of day.
cons: Horrible place to work. Leaders don't care and works you to death. 70 hours weeks are the norm. I have been exposed to a handful of clients in the central region; it seems that none of these clients are happy with the services that Unisys is providing. The managers thinks by introducing a new face, they solved the problems and keep the client of their back. Here is your ""Savior""  I am sure these clients are looking to drop us. I seen one or two already do so in the last few months. The leadership team I am working with are super EXTRA MICRO Managers (Don't know how else I can describe them). they will not let anyone do what is right. Paper work night mare; way too many daily, weekly and monthly reports to only make the manager looks good. Same report is produced 10 different ways and still do not like it if they sees a red dot. We don't have time to manage the customer, we have to manage the managers expectations. They lie to clients about capabilities that they have and expect the team to drop ""Manure"" to cover it.

[pros: It can be a means to an end, but not to the level of other bulge bracket investment banking platforms
cons: The franchise is completely unstable, and has degraded over the last few years.  You will not even get a meaningful investment banking experience due to senior turnover in the last few years in core verticals (Healthcare / TMT), ongoing litigation concerns, and an inability to compete or attract talent.  Your seat is absolutely not guaranteed.

You WILL be expected to work investment banking hours with an investment banking attitude.  You will work for unambitious, incompetent managers that have no genuine care for your development (or sanity).  The stock's not undervalued; it's just actually that crappy of a platform.  I wish you the best of luck if you commit to DB, because you will certainly need it.

[pros: The pay and other benefits were good. The multi level health insurance helped some employees with cost, but I understand not every branch received the same health care options.
 Many of the office and shop workers were a joy to work with, even through process improvement. Most could handle the job changes with professionalism. It was good to work with other departments in other states to bring forth new ideas and process controls.
cons: They promote employee engagement activities, but none of the suggestions from the engagement focus groups were realized in any significant way.  There is a huge disparity between the benefits between the office workers and the shop workers, things like Christmas bonuses. 
I did not have contact with many upper management personnel, so I can't speak to them. However, the mid level supervisors and branch managers played favorites, much to the detriment of the efficiency of the company. Many good employees left or were let go, instead of the employees that did not (do not) do their job ethically and efficiently within the company values. Those that were not the favorites were treated like lower unintelligent life forms.
 There was too much CYA, and most were afraid to voice their opinions because the more vocal employees were let go eventually for other trivial reasons that would normally not be cause for termination. Some opinions were voiced many times from different people, but it seemed that management just brushed off their concerns because it made management look bad.
Many of the other branches would not even promote our branch.  In fact, the company newsletter would write about almost every other branch except for ours, even when provided with material.
Some departments were not managed well with their resources.  Sometimes it is necessary to work overtime to get a project done or in the ""busy season"".  However, too many times there were some people working over 60 hours a week, without adequate compensation or just plain old kudos for their dedication to the company.] =",good,neutral,good

[pros: My DSM was very gracious with his time.  He put in the work to help you succeed.  However, he tries to become your friend rather than your boss.  He is unprofessional at times when he should be presenting a professional character.  He is knowledgeable about the products.
cons: TONS OF TURNOVER.  Management will hire anyone and see who can cut it.  I was hired away from a reputable wealth management firm b/c I was promised higher commissions.  I ended up sharing a desk with an ex-McDonald's employee with no college degree or experience outside running a cash registrar.   Commission based.  The compensation structure is very skewed.  At times I thought I was owed commission dollars only to find out it was not owed to me b/c of some random expense management fails to disclose to you.  THE PRODUCTS ARE NOT PRICE COMPETITIVE.

[pros: The job is steady and consistent. To the company's credit, they have transitioned all employees to remote work in light of COVID-19, and I am grateful for the ability to work at this time.

Solving complex issues, especially when the customer is grateful, is both engaging and fulfilling.

The pay is adequate, though not great or even necessarily competitive for the area, especially when starting as a contractor.

Coworkers are great and the rare instances in which we can collaborate together always leave me impressed with the range of talents we have as an organization, even if those talents are not often recognized or rewarded.

This job is not physically demanding. Despite all the negatives that come with working here, it is still a desk job where you can sit in climate-controlled offices while working.
cons: Our customers, while normally agreeable, can occasionally be very difficult to deal with.

Management has a strong tendency to bloviate about positive change while doing very little to effect that change.

Some of the applications which agents are hired to support are extremely challenging to learn. Despite long training periods, retention of new contractors is very low. Out of a class of 20+, 1-5 might be left after peak season.

Low contractor retention results in severe understaffing, which has historically caused 3+ hour phone queues.

Support staff are commonly either excluded from company-wide meetings slated as ""all-in"" or are pulled early to take calls or chats which have piled up as a result of management's refusal to close support queues during these meeting times. Contractors are regularly excluded altogether from these meetings and most campus activities.

Increasingly frequently, management has taken the opportunity to encourage everyone during meetings to submit positive Glassdoor reviews. As a result of this, there have been a surge of very positive reviews placed by management as well as a surge of very negative reviews from current or former employees. The decision I've made to publish this review is a result of these transparent attempts by management to solicit positive reviews.

There are significant discrepancies between what tenured agents earn and the starting salary of new hires, such that new agents being hired consistently earn more than their counterparts with years' more time and experience with the company. This is not to say that new hires should make less, but that management should be proactive and make sure that they are awarding adequate raises to those who decide to stay with the company.

Despite having changed the format of the survey form which is sent to customers after calls to clearly differentiate between the customer's satisfaction with their interaction with the support agent (OSAT) and their satisfaction with Sage as a company (tNPS), performance metrics have since been adjusted so both questions impact the support agent. If the customer you assisted is extremely satisfied and ranks their interaction with you as a 10, but gives Sage as a company a 1 because they are unhappy that wait times were too long or that their support plan is too expensive, (both things that an agent has no control over and may not even be mentioned on the call) that 1 is still reflected on that agent's metrics.

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a toxic and consumer-unfriendly business model that Sage is placing more and more emphasis on as it becomes the norm in the wider market.

Management has placed a continually increasing burden on support staff to generate sales leads. This means that, despite customers calling support for help, they will end up being offered training, additional licenses, expert services, and anything else management feels can be shoehorned into support conversations. (Do you enjoy calling your ISP or cable company about issues with your service only to be asked if you want to upgrade your plan?)

While management insists that lead generation should only be undertaken when it is a good fit for the customer, this is contradicted by their mandate that a particular percentage of interactions must be a good fit in order to meet rapidly rising performance metrics. For perspective on just how rapidly these metrics are increasing, in the few years I've worked here, they have increased from 4 leads per month (a flat amount) to 21 leads per month (average of 300 calls per month multiplied by an expected ratio of 7%).

As other reviews have stated, consistency of quality of managers is extremely hit or miss. There are some managers at this company that genuinely elicit trust and respect - not only from their reports, but from those on other teams. Unfortunately, some (or more accurately, most) of the management team does not live up to this standard. Here is a short list of particularly egregious examples of a single manager's (reported and ignored) misconduct: outright refused a customer-requested escalation, tried to imply that sharing one's own salary information was illegal, and downplayed reports of inappropriate touching and staring by older male team members (on multiple occasions,) even actively meeting privately with and discouraging those affected from sharing their experiences. Even ignoring all other issues discussed here, reporting to this individual is what makes me dread coming to work each day.] =",terrible,neutral,excellent

[pros: Can’t think of a single good thing about working here

Not given the proper tools to do the job and then berated when the product ships late because extra work was involved to complete the product.

[pros: The PTO is pretty nice, and if I don't mention how great the insurance is, I'll be scared Jimmy K would hunt me down.
cons: They are inconsistent with many of their own messages to the employees, and customers. For example, they have been telling us that our health is the number one priority this entire pandemic, but when the leadership of one of the departments I work with all caught COVID-19, they didn't clean the area, quarantine any of the employees that had been in close proximity to them, or even ask for the technicians that were possibly exposed to them to be tested.

An example of them not putting their money where their mouth is would be the amount of times we have been verbally thanked for working during this pandemic. We lost people on our teams to this virus and, arguably, risked our lives every time we pulled into the parking lot to come to work. To only be offered verbal thanks is not only insulting, but it also shows how far the supposed appreciation really goes.

There was also the case of what was said to us at the beginning of the pandemic. We were told we would be approved for up to 90 days of unscheduled time off, and people were appreciative of it. With all the panic around COVID-19 and employees living with or themselves being people who were immunocompromised, it was seen as an industry-leading olive branch to us. You would not be penalized for taking up to 90 days, except it wasn't true. I can think of at minimum 7 contractors that I know of who had taken advantage of the generous offer that were rejected from being hired on to the company because they utilized that offer. If you aren't going to hire an employee because they took time off that you told them they wouldn't be penalized for, then you're a liar, in my book. Plain and simple. Once again, this is just the contractors that I personally know, but friends that I have in the other buildings were telling me the same thing was happening to contractors in their buildings.

There is a multitude of things that I could say for cons, however, and many, many posts I could call back to that I and my coworkers have made on WWT's own in-house version of glass door. I don't have the patience to mention all the grievances I have, so suffice it to say that anyone giving this company five out of five stars has their head in the sand. All of the problems I've mentioned and referenced are available for anyone that is a part of this organization to look over for themselves, and to pretend as though this company has nothing it can improve on is either an outright lie to benefit this company from leadership or someone who has no interest in seeing this place return to its former glory.] =",bad,terrible,terrible

[pros: Was a great place to work when it came to India in 2010
you can get paid without doing much work
Transportation is provided (AC Bus)
cons: Please do not attempt to reason out things or ask questions, you may lose your job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The MNC culture has vanished , the concept of great place to work is just a camouflage , they make you feel that they are listening to you, thay they brain wash you into believing them and then they say that they have succeded
The concept of career management is just a way of ensuring that you don't feel that your an expert or a professional in any domain, based on the concept of JACK OF ALL TRADES AND MASTER OF NONE
You will get a good appraisal or promotion only if you are able to flatter your supervisors, if you try telling them to take a different approach (even if that is the right way) you will be cornered and made to suffer
Partiality, unfair appraisals, favoritism are the core values to this company
You need not have the knowledge about the profile you are handling,you just need to know how to flatter you boss
Management emphasizes on teamwork, but the HR Department itself lacks it, (very evident when they fail to stand up for the team and point hands on others ) .
MNC Banner but worse than a muncipal coporation
Worst C & B team, no employee friendly tax structure, show you an amazing package  but end of the month you get only peanuts
Every month you will receive a different package, and the deduction are not clear, tax is different every month even if your salary is the same
Will not get a proper response from C&B team , you may get one reply after several followup ( sometimes months or even a year) and that will also not be satisfactory
Payroll is outsoursed and not internal ownership to clarify doubts of employees] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: Can potentially make some good money. If you really stick it out you could move up the ranks. Good way to add achievements to resume for later. Most of management were very friendly and nice people. There were great motivational videos we were made to watch and speeches we were made to listen to. Fun office environment. Some people strive at this type of job and have made over $100,000 a year. Can learn a lot of valuable marketing and sales techniques here. They provided a great product that really does sell itself. I was contacted by a customer who purchased a knife from me who went out of her way to tell me she loved it.
cons: Management is pushy. They hire in bulk (anyone can get the job) and in fact I had no Idea who or what this company was about until they reached out to me for position enticing me with promises about a guaranteed $17 an hour and an opportunity to make way more.I went to a group interview with them which was one of many that day and all 5 people at my interview were hired. In total around 20 people were hired and over half stopped coming or quit within a few months. It was marketed as ""work when you want"" but if you're an active Sales rep then you have to make at least one presentation a week. Stressful at times with management on your back. You have to contact people you know to sell knives which seems easy at first but it can be tough. It's not what it seems. I can't even explain why it's so bad but they say you get paid $17 an hour but the amount of work leading up to the hours that get counted towards that exceed it being worth it. All the hardships of a sales job (hours of phone calls/ scheduling) except you can only call people you know or were recommended to. You either devote everything you have to it or don't bother dealing with this company. Don't let the 2 stars throw you off completely because like I said, some people seriously strive here. It's just that most people probably won't be able to get into this company.] =",bad,bad,excellent

[pros: Free beer every two months. Free high-sodium snacks and sludge-grade insta-coffee. Super cool people with which to commiserate. If you can maintain the Candide-level naiveté that I had when I got the job, who knows, sky's the limit, I guess.
cons: I was punished or reprimanded at least every other month for really minor things. For example, I once added humorous product features to kitsch art. Management did not find this funny. Another time I was punished was for speaking directly to the department head.

I once asked a CO what he thought about net neutrality and he scowled, reciting an ambiguous line about liking free markets.

Twice I applied for jobs in departments more amenable to my experience and was told that not only would I not get the job, but I should stop applying altogether since they would never consider me. (I got a job in the field after I left Wayfair)

Twice I was told I would not receive a raise or promotion because of what I posted to the company non-work forum. One of those posts was a Zoidberg meme.

Management routinely punished my immediate superiors for my behavior, to the point where my team leader actually said to me ""just stop talking.""

I once got a form rejection to a job that went to someone with zero experience. That's not an exaggeration, when she told me she got the job she said ""I don't know why you didn't even get an interview, I've literally never done anything like this."" Also losing out on this job was a friend of mine who was even more qualified than I. The girl who got the job was fired three months later for incompetence.

Wayfair salaries start at 32k. Your first raise will bump you up to 35k. Their bonus system is 0-10% of your salary, but if you made the mistake of going temp-to-perm they will prorate your bonus based on when you went full time. They will find excuses to do this to a lot of your money. Meanwhile, if you follow the W stock on google/finance, you will see the CO's selling stock on the reg to the tune of your potential lifetime earnings.

Do not work for this company unless you need to pay off some people you don't want to owe money to. And even then, only if they'll give you a rather lengthy payment plan.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

[pros: Overall... Barnes & Noble is a wonderful place to work. I love the fancy library feeling 😉, I love working around all the books, the gift section is beautiful, and everything the cafe has to offer is yummy. Learning the register is pretty simple.

•Comfortable environment 
•Business casual dress code
•30% off merchandise

All 4 shifts run at 50% staffing because of the horrid atmosphere. Pay is low and nepotism runs rampant on a couple of shifts. HR knows who signs their paycheck and their only worry is keeping gojo from being sued.

[pros: You get to work with great people, who serve more as family as time with company grows. Learn a great deal in terms of business; specifically profit management, product sell through, and how to drive results. Furthermore, you get a great deal of opportunity to develop leadership competencies such as: developing others, executive presentation skills, business analysis, etc. Hardwork and Results are rewarded with recognition, promotions, bonuses and top talent retreats.
cons: Expectation is extremely high - admittedly, unrealistically high. From business to operational expectation there is an extreme stress to deliver flawless results - however payroll and support does not effectively set teams up for success to execute as expected. Work/life balance is non-existent and the only Talent that survives with PACSUN are the people who are willing to put life last.] =",neutral,excellent,bad

[pros: The discount is great and we get first dibs at purchasing items that just arrived in the Stock Room.

Clothing and style is encouraged, dress up days are fun.

Fast paced environment makes you learn a lot about yourself and capabilities.

If you've been a fan of Hot Topic for years (I've been for over a decade) the this job is for you, must have passion and patience for it though.
cons: The training, if any, is SUPER LIMITED. Needs to be more structured, if that were the case then we'd have better understanding of what is expected of us AND know the system, payroll, district charts, etc.

Hostile work environment (depending on the other ASM's), made up drama and unprofessionalism is plenty. Would make anyone that is an adult leave immediately.

No higher pay for a Bilingual Manager, should be payed extra for helping out in such an important way that does not create barriers but creates the sale/conversion/return customer.

Inconsistent Hours, please have something more stable.

Penny pinching AF with pushy sales-driven goals and lying to customers with add-ons and promos. 

Low morale, no upbeat anything if you're doing well. It all depends on the actual Managers, if they wish to be encouraging and congratulatory.

Backrooms are TINY and only have ONE stock person in outlets. The stock person at our store left sick for a few days and it befell on the Full time ASM to clean everything and she takes it out on the others ALL the time, super unprofessional.

Disillusioned with this company overall, especially the archaic ways of running the store and the Hostile Work Environment and verbal abuse.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: - Co-workers range from decent to quite friendly
- Most regulars are friendly and understanding if issues arise
- You can apply for dental, vision and other health benefits after less than a year of employment 
- Paid time off is a nice perk that you earn pretty easily
cons: - You cannot work 40 hours or more per week unless you want to face consequences from management. Funny enough, you will almost certainly work longer days than you anticipate when you clock in. Even if your only part-time, this job can wreak havoc on your social life and your other commitments (I.e. school, family, volunteering, etc.)
- You will sometimes be scheduled hours you did not ask for that conflict with your life outside of work.
- Cashier supervisors will ask you to do work that is completely outside of your department. 
- Management often refuses to stand by its employees when conflict arises. For example, if I explain to a member that they cannot purchase a TV once the instant savings period has ended, they will complain to management to have them override the sale price. Of course the employee is dragged through mud by the member and management doesn't know how to stick to the polices that they're supposed to enforce. Cell phones has this issue all the time in particular.
- Anything register related will likely require a manager or COS (they supervise the front end registers). It takes forever for them to show up and help complete transactions. Some members are terribly impatient so this doesn't always go well.
- You will never acquire enough knowledge from the training period or have enough co-workers available to keep the members happy --- remember that. 
- It takes forever for a pay increase to occur and it's very small.] =",bad,neutral,excellent

[pros: The best reasons to work there are probably the compensation and the reputation of the company. Moreover, you will be surrounded by smart and capable individuals. It is a very dynamic and fast paced environment.

We are a short staffed department and now take on the job of three to four people.  They dont offer overtime, but we work overtime, go figure....AKA, they dont pay us for overtime, we have to ""wash"" it, meaning they have us work less hours the following week after working OT the prior week in order to keep hours under 80 per ck. The management knows less about the job than the employees.  Training on new procedures is quick and incomplete, but management gets mad when you dont get the procedure right away.

[pros: No Pros! The company has no consideration for their employees. You are just a tool to move their fright. They will squeeze everything out of you and pay you nothing.
cons: Everything. No money, no life. The worst CDL job in the industry. The worst company I have ever worked for. They treat you like garbage, and the only thing they care about is you driving the truck from point A to point B. You will spend more money on the road than what you make. I made from 150-200 per week. It's not up to you how much you make it about how long you drive. Lots of factors going into how you get paid, but at the end you'll never make enough to brake even after all of you COLA expenses. The company will only pay for a bus ticket for you to go back home if you get injured on the job, so if you suffer a major injury while on the job, expect a long bus ride home. You will be way from home for a minimum of four weeks, living in a truck with someone you don't know and making no money.

[pros: Extreme is really good: pros as below:
1) A very well managed company. Most of the systems are cloud based and the on-boarding , access to right tools etc is very quick
2) The culture is broadly team based. People are generally nice & there is a  feeling of warmth & friendliness which is not so common in tech companies!
3) Unlike my previous employer the pace of change (i mean in a negative way) is not that dramatic. Meaning you do the role you get hired for and there is support/guidance to help you achieve your goals.
4) The upper management (VP & above) is down to earth and do hear your ideas. So there is ample visibility if you are smart and hard working
5) Flexibility is high across the organization. There is an adequate balance on working from home vs office. also, the work pressure is not that crazy, although it does differ from org to org & time to time
6) With the acquisitions, (Avaya + Brocade) the technology stack is very good and complete. The future outlook is bright. With the right focus & energy, it can give the likes of Juniper a run for its money
7) The folks are also smart. Most of them are from tech companies like Cisco, Avaya, Juniper and there is fair bit of learning that is available
8) The company encourages its employees to attend various conferences/offsites. Travel is one of the most liberal that i have seen
9) There is adequate fun with parties/lunch/barbeques through out the year. Diwali & Christmas party are pretty grand events
10) Free snacks of considerable variety, soda & coffee if i may permit to add so
cons: 1) Comp can surely be better
2) Bonus is on & off. 
3) There are 3 large office locations and sometimes you are nor sure what is really going on. There needs to be better communication
4) The talent pool can be further improved i.e more training and hiring more talented employees vs current] =",neutral,neutral,excellent

2) Free parking.
cons: 1) Shoddy training. Sorry trainers but it simply wasn't thorough enough.
2) No free WiFi for your employees. Yes I realize that it's a ""perk"", but what are we... trapped in 1999, when WiFi was still considered cool?! Get with the times!
3) No internet access at all, even in that lousy 
quiet room with the three PC's in it. They might as well put a Commodore 64 in there; it would ve just as useful.
4) It's a completely paperless environment. No note taking to help new recruits ease into their transition onto the floor, which really trickles down to my next point!
5) Their support staff is comprised of call center reps who don't get paid to support you. So is it any wonder that they often get snooty when you ask them a question? What's in it for them if you learn your job? Nothing.
6) Kiss your cellphone goodbye. If they spot you with a cellphone on the floor kiss your job goodbye. They even have signs on the washroom doors prohibiting cellphone use while you're in dispose.] =",terrible,neutral,none

cons: If you're an associate on the salesfloor expect to be eventually trained in 3-4 departments around your own as after 5 they tend to have minimal staffing other than what is absolutely essential.  I work in photo/electronics but am also trained to assist in (and often end up having to with only 2 electronics personnel on staff) wireless, fabric, paint, cutting keys, and occasionally doing fishing licenses.  Expect having to juggle customers while trying to get shelves stocked, during the day it is not bad as normally staffing is ok but 2nd and 3rd shift it becomes much more difficult.  No healthcare benefits if you're part-time and do not work an average of 30 hours.] =",bad,neutral,bad

[pros: I've met some great people over the years who work for the Broward County Schools.
cons: I have been an educator in the Broward County Schools for over twenty years and am appalled by the lack of professionalism shown by our superintendent toward the educators of this county, many of whom like myself have given many years of their lives to help students in the Broward County Schools only to be treated  like they do not matter at all.  
Here are the latest statistics regarding teaching salaries throughout the state of Florida by county and the cost of living by county. I knew things were bad for Broward County teachers but I couldn't believe that they were as bad as they actually are. Ready for this: the cost of living in Palm Beach County and Broward County are tied for highest in the state and Dade County is in second place tied with Sarasota County. Now guess where the teaching salaries for each county are at. Out of a total of 67 counties, Sarasota ranks #2, Miami-Dade ranks #4,Palm Beach County ranks #10 and Broward County ranks #49. Yes, I just said 49 out of 67 counties, when we have the highest cost of living in the state.  The other three counties I mentioned are at least consistent with cost of living increases, but Broward County keeps paying its teachers less and less so they are unable to live.  Yet while our superintendent keeps cutting teacher salaries, he keeps increasing administrator salaries making them the highest paid in the state. For the past two years he has forced high school teachers against our contract to teach an extra period for free, and now wants to pay us back over a 20 year period. Isn't that a slap in the face!  His latest decision is to freeze teacher salaries on Steps 20,21 and 22 only because this is where the greatest salary increases take place so that teachers like myself will never reach the highest pay level that we should have already been at if there wasn't already a freeze on salaries for three years.] =",bad,terrible,none

[pros: The people are amazing here, so smart and collaborative. 
The opportunity - I have flexibility to figure out how to set and reach my priorities, some of my biggest successes started with a conversation or taking something off my manager's to do list.
The flexibility - almost 15 years working from home, flexing around some personal challenges (and fun times too).  I am grateful every day for this as a single mom!
Good ideas come from everyone - this is really true as part of our culture of meritocracy and continuous development.  Senior leaders ask a lot of questions here, and it's part of our secret sauce.
Commitment to leadership development -very proud of this as it's my day job.  It's a real and special part of this company. We reach many thousands of people each year.
cons: There is a lot of change - sometimes all at once.  Can be distracting and tough if you are loving what you are doing and who you are working for and then it switches.  When layoffs happen, they are always painful.
Big place sometimes comes with big place challenges - some clunky ways of getting things done internally...this is getting much better recently.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

Employees in each department are very helpful toward others in their own department but employees sent to other departments are ignored and treated poorly because they don't know what to do other work outside of their own department.
cons: Management can never seem to agree on a proven method of how to make things run smoothly for more than a few weeks.

Hours are very erratic and can change even from one day to the next. 

No work-to-life balance. They even told us on more than one occasion that the needs of the company come first so basically they play God with your scheduling and expect you to be okay with it when it consumes your life.

There is no change management policy and people are just shuffled around with no consideration for career paths. My manager has zero leadership skills.  1/1s are cancelled often and experienced individuals on the team are underutilized.  Lots of wasted time on developing processes that are never implemented. - this company operates as a startup! There are a lot of talented people here that will leave because their managers are stifling their growth and creativity and not allowing employees to use their skills.

[pros: The product is wonderful and Salesforce uses it heavily internally.  you're fully immersed in the Salesforce ecosystem and it's easy to understand why customers love the product so much.  There is great drive to get things done and deliver.  Salesforce scales in some really interesting ways and there is no shortage of challenges to dig into and learn from.  With all the growth, it is constantly abuzz with activity and it can be exciting.
cons: People management is very bad...
There is massive title inflation.  0-1 year of experience managing people marks most directors, and even many senior directors.  There is a serious problem of cronyism in many departments.  VPs promote who they want, when they want irrespective of team feedback or even despite what are believed to be established policies.  VP-level leadership exhibits schizophrenic decision making, CYA behaviors and abrasive comportment.  This makes for highly stressful working environments and is a key cause of the well-known burnout at Salesforce.   Many leaders at Salesforce have never done a job this big before which can lend to insecurity and erratic or absent decision making.  Reorganizations are painfully frequent which also promotes insecurity & stress.] =",good,neutral,excellent

Anyone in the clique can break the rules but if you are new you better not have an opinion or you will get written up. They are more concerned about lunch and brown nosing, than working. I worked there 3 months and had 4 different shift changes. If you stand up for yourself and go against the clique they will try purposely to annoy the hell out of you to fire you or make you quit. Lots of talking behind the back and managers encourage this. They train you improperly and get upset when you use the ""skills"" you have learned. HR was a joke.

[pros: The day to day people you work with are great. Remote
cons: Pay is all over the place. Some management make less than entry level positions. Leads making less than their ambassadors is pretty despicable. I found out that my team lead was making LESS than me, and I was making peanuts. Raises came whenever they felt like giving them. At times 6 months late. Some people never even got cost of living raises. The pay was NOT close to a living wage. When the contract was lost we were promised transparency. Instead, we got a canceled meeting and then an email letting us know we were all losing our jobs, no severance a few hours later. The same day, the person who SHOULD have given us the news was overseas opening a new office. CELEBRATING (FB ) We have since found out that the overseas staff was offered new positions, while US based employees were let go. They did give us a list of current openings in the company, but 95% of them were executive level jobs which no one was qualified for. Upper (the people above our day to day teams/managers) management changes so often and in pretty shady ways (read: just before lay-offs started key people moved jobs). They have a massive history of laying people off and trying to hire them back for HUGE pay cuts. I could go on all day with this, but honestly who cares.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Um there’s a cafeteria with places you can buy food, Starbucks, gym and game room. You get holidays off and weekends now since they changed it.
cons: Micromanaging, depending on who your supervisor is would depend on if you get any help for development or if you get any help at all when you’re struggling to meet metrics. Some supervisors have favorites and are willing to help people move up who are on finals and shouldn’t be moving up.
Systems are constantly breaking you will spend the majority of your shift trying to troubleshoot your system and if your system breaks in the middle of a call and quality can see you are having system issues then don’t expect for them to work with you or help you out because of your system issues. Management is constantly being told about all the problems but it seems as though management don’t care and just expects you to do your job with broken systems.

cons: This company taught me the dark side of greedy corporations.  Personally witnessed people being released from their jobs while being out on sick leave or after coming back from being seriously ill.  Women and men of strong morale character are bullied out of their jobs while certain directors work from home 90% of the time (aka not available out working on their own consulting business).  This company steps on the backs of their best employees for pennies while wasting $100,000's of dollars on directors and vp's that DO NOT contribute to the bottom line.

[pros: Innovative company and products. Has the luxury of making money despite its busted structure. Awesome employee recognition programs.
cons: Service engineers  generally have a natural bond and are compelled to serve customers well regardless of management antics. RSM’s are hired from the outside and most have little experience in medical imaging. This causes a continual situation of uncertainty which keeps engineers from any comfort zone. The message to RSMs year after year at Mega Meeting is to push harder on the engineers. Increase Life Solutions/Power sales and push for engagement of program with measurable quotes by each individual. As a FSE you will be hit over the head on a daily basis with the ever growing metrics. (RSN,TEDS,LIFE, PA Tool ECT.) You will find very few FSE’s grow into a RSM position at Philips as this would be too appropriate for the sake of business, and serve the FSE with a known value. As a FSE and to succeed you must turn it off like you don’t even work there at the end of the day. Upper management speaks out of both sides of their face, Say “Preferred Employer of choice” but do exactly the opposite and push FSE’s to be miserable and maybe quit. If they lose the best of the best, a FEP graduate fresh out of school can assume FE position at a reduced compensation package. It’s all about revenue at the cost of customer satisfaction and FSE personal well being so shut it down and ignore the management propaganda .] =",good,neutral,bad

They don't follow any of the policies, so if someone brings back used, dirty toys.....they'll take them back and you look like the fool when you've already said no to the customer.  That customer then comes back weekly with more nasty returns. 
Customers are allowed to yell and swear at you and management will do nothing but blame you for getting the ""nice"" customer mad!

Benefits are bottom-of-the-barrel.
No opportunity to move up or get paid more than a dollar extra to your base pay (which depends on where you live).
Job descriptions say 300 packages but always expect more than that (I've gotten 460 packages not during peak before!)
The app you use is atrocious and poorly optimized and designed; It's incredible how a Fortune 500 company, who's main focus is shipping, can't do that right.

[pros: Insight Global presents the framework for driven individuals to succeed both personally and professionally. All the tools are there, you just need to have the work ethic, diligence, and grit to use them. This is a fast paced, challenging environment, and one I love. This is definitely one of the most transparent companies in existence. Meaning, if you are performing well everyone knows it, and if you are not, everyone knows it. This model doesn't work for everyone, but if you are someone who thrives off the ""do whatever it takes"" mentality, there truly isn't a better place to work.
cons: The company highly favors the account management role over the professional recruiting position in both compensation and for options in career growth. Both positions are challenging, but the difference in difficulty does not equate to the difference in commission percentages. There should be a difference, but not as wide as it is.] =",good,good,terrible

cons: Things move fairly slowly, since everyone is worried about being a ""steward of the brand.""  Since it's headquartered in Paris, you have to wait for headquarters to get a lot of things done - which means sometimes projects get scuttled.  Most of the offices are on W. 57th Street and 5th Avenue so there's no more room for people.  Interns moving into a full-time position seemed like the exception here.

[pros: -Lots of independence and you can structure your day (very little micromanagement)
-Outside work and work at your own pace
-Good pay when there's work
cons: -You pay for ALL tools, replacement tools, meters, gas, vehicle maintenance, etc.
-Company apps are very poorly programmed and regularly go down/crash, sometimes multiple times per work day
-Work load varies greatly (sometimes only 2-3 jobs per day, sometimes 6 days/week is required)
-Small gas reimbursement does not go up to reflect current gas prices, routes can be inefficient but company has no incentive to fix this since the gas is paid for by you
-Per job rates have never gone up, in fact have gone DOWN since starting, something only a per job employer could get away with (essentially pay cuts all around, for no tangible reason)
-Lumen (CenturyLink) sales does not communicate at all with techs doing the work, so there is often a big disconnect between customer expectations and what actually can be done (e.g. customers were not aware that a new install included access to their back yard or required a hole to be drilled for the cable. OR senior citizens were told they could not keep their copper line and HAD to go fiber even though they were in an area where copper lines were still serviced)
- Lumen ""technical support"" employees do not seem to be well-trained (just following a script, no matter the input from customers) and often make matters worse in trying to solve internet issues for customers by phone (e.g. customers have been waiting 5+ days with an issue as simple as plugging into a different slot, or technical support knee-jerk hard resets the modem which erases the credentials so even if the original issue further down the line is resolved, the modem no longer responds without intervention (usually a tech coming out anyway) Dealing with frustrated and irate subscribers is the norm.
- Outside techs have to wait in line in the chats for sometimes upwards of 45 minutes just to get support from the necessary departments. (That's right, on your dime because it's pay-per-job!)] =",good,terrible,good

[pros: Amazing opportunities to develop ones personal and professional skills. 

Best Team to be in  is BAS.

The team is so lively. The co ordination and understanding between each other in the team  is so well that it feels like we are working with friends. The team believes in work hard, Party harder concept. At the same time, the team also cared about the well-being of all the team members.  I had an opportunity to learn various technology platforms starting from Java  to banking to mobile app development. I have never expected that I will get such an exposure within a span of just 2 years. its easy for others to talk about BAS, but BAS is the Face of the company in front of the client. I explored my true self when I started interacting with the clients. I definitely believe that it was an opportunity for me to understand how to use my inter personal skills and technical skills together at the same platform.  I did face some challenging situations, But whats the point in working with out any challenges.  I would say that it was the best phase of my carrier.

You can't even take a break without it being interrupted.  Also this hospital is extremely understaffed, I can't even take a break without getting called back.  People are entitled to breaks and it's constant being called here.  When you are on break you should be able to leave or be off being called back.  Hire more staff and pay more decent so you can get more staff.  We have three guards for the whole hospital.  It's UNSAFE.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Great on-boarding for new hires
Multicultural work place and merit based advancement opportunities
Great chance to help small business owners and develop a network 
Base salary is decent but if you hit your quota you will make $75K easy...
No cap on commission but it requires a lot of time and effort 
VERY flexible work hours as long as you are CONSISTENTLY closing sales
cons: Most of the negatives are associated with ""plant"" which employees cannot control. The company must make it a priority to put more money into the older infrastructure to keep existing customers happy vs continuing to build out new areas just to obtain new accounts. Also, if you do not like following up with clients and using a CRM program that coincides with that, don't take this job because you will be held accountable daily. Finally, while Comcast has arguably the fastest internet, many other competitors in the market are closing the gap and since there are issues with reliability in certain areas, you will have to be the type of salesman who sales themselves well.] =",good,good,bad

[pros: Shopee hires every-single-day and if you want chill/stagnant job, this is for you. With Shopee its like falling in love. 1st month, you'll be all over Shopee. 6th month you start to see flaws. After a year - you'll be completely out of love. And before you'll be able to complete be out of love with Shopee - its too late, they already have someone to replace you. At least, I can guarantee you'll be able to stay in Shopee for a year :) Its a fun and energetic team eventhough its toxic.  

- Used to have tea time, now no more :(
cons: - With above point, they hire new people most of the time - they don't groom their internal. So can forget about career progression if you join here.  Like I said, stagnant. 

- When they say they hire multiracial, ask them the percentage of at the 3 main races in Malaysia. You'll be able to tell how 'multiracial' they are. 

- HR internally is corrupted and integrity is not their thing. i.e Decision been made cater to their own opinion, biggest issue - change of policy, change of contract clause. 

- There's OT allowance, but not applicable to those earn > RM3000. But expected to work extra hours. Great! #LifeAtShopee

- Young, fresh hire. Sounds fun? Indeed. However there's a fine line between young and matured hires. Nothing is wrong to hire fresh grad and give them position that requires prior experience. But, it is wrong to give authority and power to the inexperience employee. No advantage if you have experience cos they don't know how to appreciate. Maybe upper management have insecurity issue.] =",bad,terrible,excellent

[pros: * Higher than average starting pay if you get the right manager.
* 10% employee discount.
* 401k
* Easy to progress up through the company if that's the kind of career you're interested in.
cons: * No benefits for three years as a part-timer.  
* Cashiers are required to perform the ""Move-It-All"" policy, which is when someone leaves something in the shopping cart, the cashier is required to lift it and look under it for stolen merchandise.  If you fail to perform the move-it-all, you will be fired (the company is actually in the process of installing motion sensor security cameras in their stores to automatically monitor whether cashiers are performing the policy).  This doesn't sound so bad except S&F is a bulk item warehouse selling primarily to businesses.  Most customers (I would say 1 in 3) come through with 6+ cases of water, 3 bag-in-a-box sodas, 5 5-gallon jugs of oil, 90 2-liters of soda, etc.  I have known several employees who have suffered serious back injuries due to this policy.  I have also been accused of being racist while performing this policy, and have been yelled at many times by regular business customers who are deeply offended by us checking to see if they are stealing each time they shop with us.  In a year there I have only ever found one packet of $0.99 taco seasoning left in the basket, yet we lose over $200 a day to customers just walking out the door with items under a jacket, because we have neither an alarm system nor a security guard.  Cashiers are expected to run after people who are stealing.  One recently almost got run over by the getaway car.
* Never enough employees there per shift.  There have been several occasions when only myself, one manager, and one service clerk were present for over three hours during a busy day.
* Registers are poorly set up.  The bagging counter is tiny (only about a foot square...and yet we're a bulk item warehouse with most customers purchasing $100+ orders) and the bags are located underneath the counter at the level of my shins, maximizing back stress.  For the first year I was there, we had no mats.  We stood on the bare concrete for 8 hours. 
*  Not all stores have scan guns.  The first store I worked at did not have them, and we were required to lift all items left in the cart onto the register - even 50 lb bags of carrots.  We were explicitly NOT ALLOWED to use the Quantity Key (I actually had a customer once sarcastically ask me if I knew how to use the quantity key), and only allowed to type in the code if the item doesn't scan.  This is in order to ""minimize loss"".] =",bad,neutral,good

[pros: Training is decent , they will pay you a ramp, clear expectations are given , and decent insurance /free food in the office
cons: I had very high hopes for RingCentral as they are rated very highly on Glassdoor which is on of the reasons I applied to the BDR role there. Unfortunately though the organization fell short on many levels. Managers hired there are little to no help with the role as they do not know the role themselves with a few exceptions and micromanaging is something that they thrive on. New hires that are hired are quitting at an incredible rate as well because the role is not explained to them and are given no support from management to do their job well. (Nearly 7 people left in the time I was there) One of the things you will hear from management is to make more calls which sometimes works but with no strategy around it can be a waste of time. The sequences that you are required to use as well do not match with all segments so have little effect. But one of the worst parts of the job was the data that was in the system . Accounts constantly changing so you had no idea what to pursue , not even the larger account reps knew that they were changing sometimes. There were also so many trainings for products that you barely had time to do your job ! Also if you are looking to survive in Denver the salary is lower than what the rest of the market is making and the quotas even for a seasoned BDR are so high that you barely can make the numbers unless you are cheating the systems getting reps to “give you meetings”. The second part of the compensation “stage 3s” do not align with all segments either so most likely you will be constantly losing money.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: If you’re a nurse, it seems to be a good place to work. Most of the positive reviews here are from nurses.

Health plan decent, though most within Scripps network

Free parking 

Matched retirement contributions
cons: Technical staff are the lowest-paid in the area and the CEO is the highest-paid. Tells you all you need to know. 

This used to be a good place to work for years, but they kept putting more work on everyone without any additional compensation. Nearly every department is understaffed without additional budget for hiring more help. This is a non-profit in name only. They have to make sure to get the last productive drop out of every staff member without additional time off to make sure the CEO and upper management make lots of money. 

The PTO is pitiful. Read and understand the policies before you take a job at Scripps because management will sugar-coat it before you are hired.

It takes 86 hours of full-time work to accrue just 1 day of PTO. Your PTO encompasses sick time, vacation, and holidays. You are forced to use your own PTO for holidays, even if you don’t celebrate those holidays. If you get sick, which you will because the job will burn you out, there goes your vacation time. There is disability time you can accrue separately from PTO, but good luck using it. You have to have papers signed by doctors and your managers, opening your personal life up to the scrutiny of your managers if you want to have even just a couple days off for health reasons. If you have to care for a sick loved one, you get less than a week of paid time to do so for the entire year.

After the forced holidays, it calculates out to just 17 days of PTO you earn per year as a full-time employee — sick and vacation time. If you’re a robot who never gets sick, I guess Scripps could be a good place for you to work.

They don’t treat employees as well as they used to at Scripps.] =",neutral,terrible,excellent

No timely appraisals or systematic review process. Most of us end up taking paycuts while joining and are asked to wait for a couple of years until salaries are hiked.

[pros: - The people - you'll work with some of the friendliest, funniest, most passionate people you'll ever meet. Everyone's trying to make the best games possible and keeping each other sane.
- The IPs - you get the opportunity to work with all kinds of licenses, from Marvel to Pixar to Star Wars to DC, etc. There's really nothing like it when one of your favourite licenses rolls around and you get to work on content for it.
- Variety in projects - you won't be bored working on one thing for 18 months at a time, because the projects roll thick and fast.
- Portfolio builder - you'll get multiple titles for your portfolio within a year or two
- Paid overtime - during crunch you're paid overtime, otherwise you accrue extra hours as flexitime. You will likely stock up on these quickly.
- Secure - never seems to be any sign of slowing down.
cons: - The people - the old-guard range from 'stuck in their ways' to 'difficult to work with' to just plain useless. Conversely, most of the workforce are so fresh from uni they're still figuring it all out in the first place. There are some incomprehensibly enormous egos to contend with across the board.
- The processes - communication between departments, or even within departments, is shambolic. ""Us and them"" attitudes permeate every aspect of the job, whether it be other disciplines or other studios or even other teams within the same discipline. Collaboration does not exist on a project-wide scale, it is up to individuals to really push it - those who do are a pleasure to work with, but they're the minority. Production try to schedule projects, but that's kind of impossible given how tight the project timelines are.
- The tools - just awful.
- The deadlines - the company pumps games out at a rate of 3-4 per year across two studios. That means you're pumping out a game what, every 9 months? That comes at a human cost. One option is you're putting the extra hours in, because it is literally impossible to make a game working 7.5 hours a day for that amount of time. The other option is that you are not doing this, meaning the work just gets lumped on your teammates instead. There's very little explicit mandatory overtime or anything like that, but if you don't get your work done, no one else will, or one of the core 30 people who never seem to leave the office will have to do it. And that's that. 
- The location - Knutsford is a crap place to live for anyone under 60. If you can't drive, you're really trapped, as the public transport is run as if it were an optional nicety. It's almost as if it's purposefully isolated from other games studios so you can't get any perspective.
- The pay - it's low.
- Upward mobility - seemingly almost entirely random. Sometimes people who are bad at their job are promoted just to keep them out of the way.  Different teams have wildly different processes and expectations for how and when people are promoted. 
- No room to innovate - titles come out so frequently that there's hardly any room for creativity from anyone other than directors. Your job will most likely be adapting something from a previous title into a new one, which is always weirdly difficult despite how common an occurrence it is
- Training - what training? No time to train newbies when another game is always 6 months from release.] =",bad,terrible,excellent

[pros: Free beer, pub for the employees
cons: Extremely poor DE&I, demographic is largely white male. The board of execs, president and VP's are all white male.

Expect racial slurs to be thrown at you, example South Asian and Arab employees would be greeted with 'hey there's my favorite terrorist'. Extremely poor work life balance, expect colleagues and managers to call you at midnight to get work done and you work long hours 12-14 hour days are a norm. Underpaid compared to market average, their reasoning is because they give high bonuses, however no bonuses have been given in 5 years. Men get promoted based on potential, women get promoted based on experience (and rarely get promoted). Aggressive, unprofessional behavior is rewarded. A lot of bias towards pregnant employees and working mothers. A lot of issues around gender bias and racial bias.

The managers are petty and will block you from succeeding, yet get mad when you leave. I witnessed managers and directors trash talking former and current employees, which made for an uncomfortable and unprofessional environment. HR is absolutely useless, so if you have a question don’t even bother asking. There has been restructuring, but it’s on the hush and there is lack of clarity, causing panic and gaping holes on teams that they won’t backfill.

[pros: The WBG remains an important global institution and the place is staffed with many bright, dedicated individuals. They also have a great cafeteria.
cons: The organization is extremely hierarchical, with a lot of time spent ensuring that you consult others within the organization. In addition, the opportunities for career advancement can be challenging, as there is little flexibility or mobility and you basically have to hope that a position opens above you. The short-term consultants have it the worst, being treated as disposable. This poor treatment of low-level staff is especially galling considering the generous salaries and plush treatment that high-level staff receive. Finally, the people in staff roles are so overworked themselves that they have a hard time advocating for others. Not a supportive work environment overall.] =",neutral,neutral,bad

Severe lack of diversity in Sales and Marketing management positions in field and HQ. Tend to promote people with a lack of experience or time with the company and overlook great employees with a lot of experience. Promotions go to people who look the part rather than those with skills do do the job.

-if you have a manager who is ""burnt out"" your life will be miserable, pray for a good manager!

[pros: --20% discount effective immediately upon employment, 40% discount on certain ""double discount"" days that occur a few times a year.
--Management is willing to work with your schedule and has no problem granting requested days off if advanced notice is given.
--The work-life balance is excellent for most retail associates, which gives them time to work outside jobs, attend school, or be with their families.
--Looks good on a resume for other retail positions.
--The store is closed on major holidays.
cons: --Unless a rare full-time position is available, ALL associates start out part-time. This means that you can work anywhere from 8-25 hours, with 18 being the average. Also, the average hourly wage for associates is about $7.50/hr. This is okay if you are a college student or a housewife who doesn't really need a job, but if you have to solely support yourself and your child(ren), this job alone won't be enough.
--The work is hectic. The store is often completely destroyed, and only 3-4 associates are left at the end of the day to clean up the mess.
--Home office is cheap in terms of payroll. Managers are made to function with the least number of staff members as possible. Because the registers are the main priority, this often results in floor staff having to double as cashiers--which in turn leads to them not finishing their assigned department. However, if management attempts to help out on the floor or assist associates in need, they are berrated by their superiors for not ""supervising"" enough.
--Improper training. New associates are often thrown into a disaster-ridden department and told to ""recover"", but they don't know what that means. As a result, they spend their entire shift detailing one small section rather than focusing on the overall neatness of their area.
--Low expections in terms of punctuality and attendance.] =",terrible,bad,excellent

Keep in mind the starting wage was already at 9.60. First proposal got voted down, everyone was able to vote for this in store, second vote was done at a place 25 minutes of freeway driving away.

[pros: Well-intentioned people, who try to put a good face on how they live their values and exert a positive impact on community.  Genuine volunteer spirit runs throughout organization -- which is their raison d'etre.  They take a long-term business approach and don't obsess on quarterly numbers or get drunk with greed like you would think a Fortune 500 financial services company would.  Successful business model that has built up an enormous surplus that helps provide stability for members and employees.  Work-life balance is quite good.
cons: 100+ years of brand equity as a socially progressive Lutheran organization that serves Lutherans and their local communities has been squandered and given way to a new ambiguous Christian identity that is obsessed with pandering to evangelicals and conservative Christians who are nothing like Scandinavian Lutherans in their world outlook, political views, and values towards women, gays, and minorities.  Hence, Thrivent is struggling to find itself.  Longtime employees are disappointed by what company has become and mostly keep their mouths shut and count the days until retirement.  New employees are strivers, bean-counters and order-takers who, quite frankly, are not very interesting or fun.  High commissions and fees aren't very competitive and sales efforts are focused on unsophisticated Christians who don't know any better, which feels icky.  Corporate giving programs now restrict employees from donating to causes that are even remotely related to gays and women's reproductive health.  CEO has consolidated power and isn't particularly interested in market research or facts that conflict with business vision or conservative faith approach to, well, everything.  That doesn't allow much room for alternative thinking, creative branding that might appeal to young adults, or research-driven insights.  Bonus payouts for rank and file employees historically have been meager and value of benefits have eroded under the watch of HR regime that simple does what it's told.  Technology is slow to evolve with the times and organizational frugality doesn't help.  Pitifully low brand awareness.] =",terrible,neutral,good

[pros: Positive interview experience with professional management staff.  Quick turn around time from interview to job offer.  Managers work along side hourly staff 'associates' doing the same jobs and working harder than most.
cons: Very little in the way of positive feedback.  Not once have I been told I've done a good job even though I go home each day sore and tired from working my butt off.  Scheduling changes can come with little to no warning.  Managers do little to motivate less productive associates choosing instead to pile more responsibility on associates that do work hard.  There is definitely an atmosphere of favoritism.  Promotions or transfers are rarely approved based on merit.  Associates often get away with no-call-no-shows while others are written up or 'coached' for such things as not taking a lunch break within their allotted time frame.  Very little communication from management unless the team has fallen short on some expectation.  Very little done to staff properly.  Always short handed.  Overtime is a dirty word.  Made to work well past quitting time frequently then told to keep track of your hours so as to avoid overtime.  That means coming in late for the next shift or two and falling behind in your assigned areas only to have to stay late again once you've balanced your hours.  Assigned to multiple areas.  Working in one area means falling behind in another and held responsible when things aren't done despite working through breaks and watching other associates take hour long lunch breaks or half hour breaks on their 15 minute breaks.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

cons: I think communication is a little lacking, especially in the hiring process. Sometimes you don't hear anything or get updates for a long period of time. Additionally, I wish used PTO could be rolled over to the next year (only allowed in California).] =",good,good,excellent

Very cliquey atmosphere and lots of favouritism and brown nosing going on.

[pros: They give prizes, shirts, amazon cups. Christmas food was ice
cons: The quota that is required to meet is nearly impossible. Job must be performed with using standards that are difficult and I was written up for making 7 mistakes out of 9000 items. The workroom floor is huge and you barely have enough time to eat lunch or even take breaks. People would literally run to try to get to the microwaves or get to their cars to make phone calls.  They have adolescents as supervisors who don't know how to deal with people of different generations. They treat older people horribly.

[pros: -Co-workers and regular customers here are amazing

-Job security is nice. Would have to mess up big time. (Not making all  ""patient outreach calls"" however, is considered messing up big time - even if there's 120+)

-Job experience is nice as well. As a future pharmacist-to-be, I'm racking up experience and have seen the good, the bad, and the plain evil of corporate run pharmacies.
cons: -Hours cut in the middle of week to meet budget and upper level management surprised when we're not doing so well. Can be very strict on hours (I've been ""written up"" for going over 5 minutes one week)

-Requires a lot of dedication with no real benefits for the dedication

-No competitive pay, and both wage and raises are static. No raise or compensation for certification. No assistance in maintaining CPhT status, or renewal of license. You pay to work for them.

-In both stores I've worked, there is ""full service"" (Pick up & Drop Off) in 2 drive-thru lanes - with 1 employee working them both and only 1 register. New ""We-Care"" system in second lane requires multiple back and forth trips of the tube while Lane 1 can be done much easier

-Little respect for employees from upper management. The customer is always right, even if its their fault. (ex: phoned in wrong medicine to be refilled)

-Numbers,numbers,numbers. On weekends, patients must be called to prompt them to fill old prescriptions. Every prescription is timed, and must be filled before said time or it counts against your execution ""score."" From when a patient calls the store to when you answer is timed. When a patient pulls into the drive-thru to when an employee pushes the button on the phone (**not when the employee is actually at the window, you must still push the button if you are right there anyways**) is timed. 

-Customer-based ""scoring."" Customers are constantly given the opportunity to ""score"" how well your performance was in helping them. This is a good idea. However, CVS has RickyBobby syndrome. When you are scored from 0-5 (0 bad, 5 excellent), anything from 0-4 gets defaulted to a 0. ONLY 5's count. If you ain't first, you're last.

-High stress environment. Even when customers are nice, it is stressful with 10+ people waiting around the pharmacy, some watching your every move. Out of our 5 full time techs, 3 have a prescription for a nerve pill.

-In my state, we often work illegally. The state board of pharmacy states the pharmacist/tech ratio should be 1:2. The worst I've ever seen is 7 techs to 1 pharmacist.] =",terrible,terrible,good

You will not be working with slackers.  The option to work from home is nice, if you can get it.  Different managers will restrict this option, so make it part of your contract if it is important to you.
cons: The micromanaging is out of control.  I've never worked anywhere that makes more of an effort to un-empower their employees.  They claim they want innovation but provide no ownership over your work.  In some divisions, leadership at the highest levels is seriously lacking, as the SVP's just bicker over their power & territory.

[pros: Great distribution center operations, field employees seemed to have cohesive teams, Halloween decorating and trick or treating for the kids of employees was fun.
cons: The CEO is an odd duck.  Little quirky things such as being allowed to wear jeans on Fridays but they can't be blue - really?  Also they are big on pre-employment testing.  So much that candidates need to pass before even getting an interview and many do not pass.  They would bring in large numbers of people to the cafeteria to take the tests together like an SAT room then have them leave after 2 hours with no interview.  Those that passed were invited back.  People felt like herded cattle.  They also have an industrial psychologist that gives final interviews to determine fit but she is a friend of the CEO and I don't think she really uses psychology as much as whether or not she likes the person.  The senior leaders have a god complex and treat regular employees like inferior beings.  Overall I felt like it was the wrong fit from about day 3 but there weren't a lot of opportunities out there so I sucked it up for a few years then jumped ship when something better came along...] =",neutral,bad,good

[pros: Since APL a University Affiliated Research Center, it's not for profit. This place is motivated by Science and Learning, NOT profits. They really care about supporting you to be the best you can, via pursuing more education, leadership roles, lisetning to new ideas, exposing you to more work experience ,etc.

Compared to other giant organizations in the defense industry, it's way easier to move around and do different work or do different things, because they want you doing work that you are motivated to do so that we all can get the best results.

There exists a whole structure for any employee to come up with brand new ideas that APL will fund . And if you begin to show promising results they will continue to fund it even further.

This place just fosters improvement all around.

Diversity distribution in management positions reflects the diversity distribution throughout the rest of the organization

The gyms on site are wayyy cheaper than any gym membership elsewhere.

I'd highly recommend any engineer or scientist strongly consider working here.
cons: Although every one here is incredibly friendly, it's very easy to be isolated. It may be related to my work specifically but there isnt a lot of very heavy team work involved in the tasks. You aren't working hand in hand with other people.

Location is not ideal for younger crowds who may want to live in bigger metropolitan areas like DC/Bethesda/Silver Spring or Baltimore. Though its totally feasible if you're willing to make the 35 minute drive.

Finally, this is an industry wide issue, and not specific to APL, but it is still dominated my predominantly caucasian males.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

The nurse should have been reported and at the very least issued warnings or some kind of consequences ( whats is the point of having a nurse be on call if they out right refuse to come in when needed??) but nurse was never reprimanded and holds management position to this day.

[pros: You get a chance to spend the day talking to customers about makeup, sharing insight, and demonstrating how to do certain elements of makeup. If you like talking about makeup, this is definitely the job for you. There's no snootiness or condescension, everyone is expected to pull their own weight and there's no room for people to start drama.
cons: You will be expected to wear many, MANY hats. By that I mean you will be asked to be cashier, product consultant, work on ad displays and planograms, restock, and also know a lot about all the other brands in the store, not just the prestige cosmetics sections.

[pros: A good amount of vacation days offered at each level. Considering you would miss out 4 months of vacation time due to the busy session. The best thing this firm has is the people. The people are amazing to work with and most of these people are hardworking and would stay in public in the long run but the majority end up getting pushed out of the firm. The new CEO is probably the best leader among all partners. The new CEO has a work hard and rewards manner which keeps people motivated. HSA Health insurance cost is low which is a good thing, and the firm provides a match for HSA participants.
cons: I worked here for over 5 years, so I have experience from multiple positions. This is only applicable for the Parsippany location. Horrible increases. You will get 5 or 6% if you perform well. You can get more in % increase but you will have to be one of the favorites. By far, this firm has the worst 401k plan where you will be vested after 5 years. 1% match with random one-time profit sharing of $500 to $700 contribution. This location’s HR is probably the worse. HR doesn’t resolve any schedule issues except they put teams in charge to figure out. You are better off getting help from NYC - HR office. This location has the worse issue out of all which is favoritism. You can see favoritism from HR to all way up to partners. If you are one of the favorites, you have it made here. When it comes to promotion, they have this odd tradition where a partner has to vouch for you, so you better get on a partner’s back if you want promotion. They won’t want to give you any screens for your desk, so people tend to steal them from the employees that reign. During most layoffs, minorities were laid off the most out of the whole layoff population. This location has no diversity whatsoever. One of the worst things HR does in this location, they book you in march for summer jobs so you can plan vacation. If you do plan vacation, you better plan around those jobs. I will not recommend anyone to work here.] =",terrible,bad,excellent

[pros: It all depends on the principal you work for.  Some are wonderful and others are not.  
Insurance benefits were great (not sure if they still are) for the teacher themselves.  I paid nothing for insurance and almost everything was covered.  
Being able to help children learn and see their faces light up when they finally ""got it!""
cons: Teachers have no say in what actually works in the classroom.  Wasting time with students making graphs with all their test scores and then taking time each week to discuss with each student, during school hours is not the best use of time.  That time is better served instructing innovative and unique lessons with the students.

Dependent insurance coverage was way too expensive.  I was paying over $500 a month for my infant to have the ""basic"" insurance.

Raises were non existent.  The only way I made my salary higher was to get my masters degree and then take a lot of workshops to qualify for the incentive $$ for having extra inservice credits.] =",bad,neutral,good

cons: This is some years ago, but when an HR representative, who is still with the company, can look at a room full of people and tell them, with a straight face,  that while changing time off policy employees are gaining a day of PTO when there is actually a net loss in time off for the year, you should get an idea of the ethics of people with which you are dealing.] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: My leader makes work enjoyable. Everybody gets along. Good culture. Supportive environment.
cons: Zero investment in IT Infrastructure. Progression is extremely limited if you work from home. Bank mainframe is incredibly outdated, using a command-line type interface.

[pros: The only pro is that there is a salary that is paid on time. This job is nothing but a paycheque. If you have a good manager the office environment can be good. Work life balance is good because no one works overtime after the bank got sued for forcing people to without pay.
cons: The sales goals are absurd, and they grow every year. When goals go up significantly without any increase in pay, its the same as a paycut. The incentive pay is a joke, especially when its near impossible to reach the required sales. The base salaries start off far below market as well. 
Do whats right for the client is a catch phrase that means very little. The turnover rate is very high and there are chronic issues with staffing, making it much harder on the remaining branch staff.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: Nice people - nice direct management
cons: Terrible software, FOX is the reason I've left this job. No time is given to audiologists to account for terrible running software. On any given day, you'd see 20-40 mins wasted on software crashes, slow loads or general tech issues. The irony is, Amplifon only provide you will 30 mins of admin time per day. So the reality is you spend all your own time catching up on notes due to their sub-standard software and systems. Unpaid over-time must be not a problem for you if you want to work here. On top of that, they pay terrible commission rates. All they care about is the bottom dollar (their weekly share price you'll come well familiar on, with their boasting emails). Funny to think you are person making that share price rise - by being underpaid and forced to use terrible software. 

The only thing keeping this company afloat employees wise is the ready-available supply of cheap Indian immigrant workers who flock into Australia ready to work for less, just to get a foot in the door to live here. 

I've worked at 4 audiology companies over 15 years and can honestly say this is by far the worst company I've worked for. Don't waste your time.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

[pros: Every employee I have met has been nice & welcoming 
Free milk & yogurt in the break room
Just renovated one of the floors in the corporate office so there are stand up/sit down adjustable workspaces
They bring in vendors to sell lunch pretty often 
Monthly employee recognition lunch (many companies don’t do this anymore!)
Lots of employees who have worked at Shamrock for 10,15,25+ years but they don’t look down on new employees, rather willing to help them and grow them
cons: Benefits. You only get Christmas Day and Thanksgiving day off even in a corporate position. 5 floating holidays but you accrue them throughout the year so if you start mid year you won’t get the previous ones. 

All benefits, PTO and sick time kicks in after 90 days so don’t get sick before then...

[pros: If you are in the right store, a quarterly bonus can be almost a guarantee.  Moving up within the company can take a little time, but is definitely a possibility.

[pros: The discount as a manager is nice, but the clothing is still so over priced that it still ends up being expensive.  Great learning experience because you HAVE to figure it out on your own to make successful numbers.  Health insurance is a very reasonable price.
cons: Lots of turn over at the corporate level and paper work is excessive and unorganized.  It is said that you don't ""have"" to buy the clothing, but not looking 100% 'brand' is extremely looked down upon and you may even lose your job if you don't.  A LOT of the paycheck goes right back to the company because of clothing purchases.  Sales associates get a horrible discount and are still expected to look brand. The brand, at least where I lived, also attracts a massive amount of organized retail crime.  That in itself is incredibly stressful... to always be suspicious of every customer.  The floor sets are demanding and the store is not allotted extra time in payroll to get them done.  Most of the time, half of the clothing (and props) haven't even arrived at the store to compete the floor set proficiently.  Promotional items for big sales always arrive late from the offices and never get to the customer on time.  Corporate hounds about client books, mean while clients feel like they're being stalked/harassed and become less impressed with the brand.  
Also, commission is only given in retail stores.  No commission is earned in partner stores.  Compared to other brands that offer commission, BCBG is on the very bottom of the barrel when it comes to commission for your sales. Most bonuses come in the form of gift certificates that can only be used on their brand.  You can only shop in your own store, you can't use your discount online or in any other stores.] =",bad,bad,bad

cons: I worked at L&T as an Android Developer. I have had a disappointing journey. They do not have any Android project. All they do is, depute you to client locations for client-support projects. They have just a couple of clients, main client being Huawei and Cisco. There was 0 work-life balance for employees deputed to Huawei. We were literally forced to work for 13-14 he's everyday. The managers at Huawei location were lame ducks, who could not help address our concerns! A lot of people have put down their papers because of the shoddy handling of the employees. Please don't join this organization if you are an Android Developer.. Another sad point is, all the praise you earn at the client location from client managers due to your efforts count for nothing once the project ends as there is no communication between managers at client location and those at L&T office.

[pros: I’m not on the diagnostic side but am with Cummins Care. The teamwork displayed is awesome. The managers are amazing and really look out for your best interest. Cummins goal is to get you moving up in the company so if there’s anything you want to learn that can catapult you in the right direction, they will help get the resources you need. The benefits are nice and there’s yearly bonuses based on merit! There are also yearly raises around the summer time that are based on merit + how well the company is doing but I’m going into my 3rd year and haven’t seen this yet (probably due to covid affecting the company). Overall I can definitely recommend working here
cons: The development side of cummins is absolutely horrifying. I don’t feel like they truly care about working with others. For example, they consulted with higher tier teams about the release of a new website, the higher tier teams advised against it and listed extremely valid points as to why, the development team didn’t take anything into consideration and released it anyway, leading to furious customers, a huge jumbled mess lasting months and surging phone lines into the main customer number and the only ones who can fix the actual issue are… well… the developers. I think this shows issues with cohesiveness and lack of care between the different teams. Also, I see a huge issue with the distributor phone numbers taking customers through a million prompts and either leading them back to the main line (when we can do nothing about it) or leading them to a person at the distributor who turns the customer back to us. It’s a headache for the customer and causes a lot of mess.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

[pros: Great compensation.  Great education.  Lots of cool people to work with.
cons: OD Senior Management that doesn't know anything about the customer nor do they understand that customer's sales cycle.  A comp model that gives the inside account rep incentive to not fight for her fair share of the forecast credit.  The comp model basically allows the outside reps to combine deals together that cut the inside rep's comp to a fraction if they fight with or dont do as the outside sales rep wants.  So, basically the inside rep has to do what they can to make inside sales management happy but at the same time their own pay is really determined by their relationship with the field who can take their deals...combine them into larger deals...and drastically reduce the inside reps comp while stealing their forecast credit.] =",excellent,good,bad

[pros: Working from home is a plus. I get to work from home as needed and I come to the office as scheduled, if I am sick I stay home so it works out pretty well. 

The stock plan is good and if you are smart, leave it and cash it once a year, I use it as a bonus.
cons: So not everything is pretty here. I was moved from a wonderful team to the ""ZOO"" yes! My team got disbanded so I ended up in some horrible poor managed non- american team. Yes I believe I am the only english speaking person, so it appears. 

My manager is rude, always ""offline"" but they want you to work nights, weekends on top from your 8-5? They are crazy!

 Please as an advice, ask for a full description of the project, to include hours worked and what they expect from you. 

The so called ""senior consultants"" in another office are also rude, they can careless when you instant message them or they even yell at you on conference calls. Never in my life have I experience such behavior from an adult! The company provides the tools for the teams to be successful but if the manager don't know how to run a team, then all efforts are pointless. Oh, and they constantly interrupt while you are talking, so rude.. no manners for so ever, where do they hire these people from? 

What I don't understand is how they stay employed? doesn't anyone notice they are never online working? 

Not all manager are horrible though, I have had the pleasure to work with some amazing individuals but this last project sealed its fate, I am taking my talent somewhere it can be put to use and not wasted.

If you dislike the team you are on speak up, if they don't listen to you, talk to the other managers, this is a common issue in this company, if nothing works, LEAVE!] =",bad,neutral,excellent

[pros: Some decent and kind colleagues
cons: It is impossible to imagine how clients pay for management advice from this firm. The HR practices are clownish. Senior managers don’t have the faintest clue how to manage people or projects. There is no functioning management structure so advancement is simply down to being liked by the boss. New hires are so shocked at the chaotic culture that there’s a swingeing bond scheme where you are forced to buy your work laptop and pay for any training if you leave, financially trapping innocent victims in a lunatic asylum.

Does that sound harsh? The boss wins business and refuses to say what he has promised the clients. He is the first one to leave the office every day. He has no idea how to resource the commitments he makes and must imagine a team of elves are doing the work overnight.

The firm advises clients strategically on HR, Finance, Marketing etc. yet is incapable of applying this to its own work. 

It is a truly difficult challenge to ascertain what the boss actually does.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

You also receive excellent training.
cons: It can be very hard to do as well as they say that you can. You will never be able to reach the level of the top sales consultants. It has nothing to do with performance. They stack the deck against you here. The leads and appointments are combed over and the best ones are given to certain people. It is completely unfair here. They constantly keep in your mind that you are replaceable. They let you know that if you leave they don’t care. They keep you in a mindset to keep you complacent to let them do whatever they want to you and basically tell you that if you don’t like it quit.  They will never fire anyone but they will gladly do things to make someone quit. They call themselves a tribe but in all reality it’s more like a cult. It doesn’t matter how well you do it’s just not good enough. The owner is a greedy butt head.  All of the management in ownership is completely two-faced.] =",neutral,neutral,excellent

[pros: Good initial training, but only if you plan on staying with Jones your entire career.  They only train you on the limited selections of investments they offer.
cons: Horrible support for new advisors from others in your own region.  They only want you to succeed to the point where you bring in a few decent accounts that they can take over once you leave.  The back stabbing among advisors is the worst I have ever seen.  When you do leave, you quickly find out that your training is very basic.  The wholesalers who see their advisors are exclusive to Jones because they don't want their advisors to know what is available to others in the industry that actually do own and run their own businesses instead of being an underpayed Kool Ade drinking employee they sucker into paying all of their overhead out of their commissions.  All for a book of business you do not own, and will never be allowed to sell when you retire.  Jones advisors are made fun of by all others in the industry, but their arrogance makes them believe it is jealousy.  I don't know why anyone would be jealous of a 25-40% payout plus paying expenses on an office and book of business that you have no ownership in.  Yeah, I'll take 90% and owning my own business, and being able to offer more advanced investments and alternatives to MY clients and the book I own any day of the week.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: The benefits are good. You get the whole healthcare spread (vision, dental, medical). There are tons of other insurances they offer as well. The pay is high, since it's an east coast company, too. Oh, and, you are basically guaranteed that this company will always exist, so job security.
cons: This place is suffering from perpetual insanity. It’sl Kafkaesque fever dream. Where do you even begin...
First and foremost, this place touts being agile, but like every other place i've worked, they are anything but agile. It is ‘saFe’, so work is organized in PI’s(3 month iterations), which locks us into deadlines that we usually cannot meet, because, well, no one can predict what will happen a week from now, let alone 3 months, but the people at this company treat your estimates like the word of god. Mid PI they will regularly change your expectations anyways, making you pivot into features that weren’t planned for, and then will arbitrarily scrutinize your pre-existing work in the process because they want to squeeze in time that doesn’t exist. In almost every new feature i’ve touched, the product side insists on pushing forward projects that aren't even possible to start because someone ‘higher up’ wants it. We are often forced to work on outdated or non-existent UI mocks, only to have them change our UI expectations mid sprint. Or the api's aren’t ready, or some other dependency we have on another team or service isn't actually set up. Or my most recent favorite is our accessibility team will tell us to do the opposite of what they told us to do prior once the code is implemented. All of these aren’t necessarily bad, or deal breakers, im always willing to accept the need for flexibility and all that, but this all becomes our own fault as a team for either writing the wrong code, not understanding accessibility, or not owning the backend services(which is impossible because im a front end dev). 
 The backend is entirely inc0mpetent. In almost every instance of setting up an API services i’ve had to 'debug' an issue with the respective API team because the documentation is literally always wrong, or after we start consuming it they decide to flat out change it without communicating it. The crazy thing is that these tasks are marked as complete for them, but when we actually use them, they almost never work. Its as if they aren’t really testing their code works before marking it as finished. Not to mention, i think every other week the services go down anyways. This isn’t that bad on the face, but did i mention that engineering leadership consistently blames the front end devs for the backend inconsistencies? We are supposed to be telling them how the backend services should work! Fascinating, and highly logical. Also, it takes days for these issues to resolve, which then eats into our productivity, which then makes us look bad for not being able to integrate backend services quickly. Oh, good segue-way into the big reason why this place sucks...
 The engineering leadership is full of people who haven't worked as developers for 15-20 years. Or even worse, some people in the engineering leadership chain have literally no years of experience as developers. Sometimes i play a game in engineering meetings where i will look at peoples linkedin accounts to see why what they are saying sounds so illogical, and trust me, it puts it into perspective.
 They will regularly critique our work flow from an arbitrary and abstract perspective without ever engaging us on what is reasonable, logical, or most efficient. It's some of the most enraging and arrogant stuff i've ever experienced as a developer to be told what to do, and how to do it, without ever having a discussion about it from my informed perspective. As a consequence we are often told to implement drastic changes to our day to day work flow for no other reason than to make leadership feel like they have something to do. Its tyrannical frankly, but in some of the most asinine ways. With the backend inconsistencies, it’s constantly pushed for us to develop on services that are inconsistent, broken, or unfinished, and then we are somehow at fault for not ‘taking ownership of the backend’ enough. We are regularly forced to read costumer complaints and compile logs of them even though there is a department already designed for that exact purpose. We are blamed for accessibility inconsistencies when the actual ADA team is telling us to do things differently depending on who you speak to, and we are told to work on features that don’t have UI mocks just ‘because you should be able to get it done’. Engineering leadership also does not know what the word tech debt means. They regularly miss use it, and when they ask us to report tech debt, they routinely tell us that we are wrong, and that it isn't tech debt. They seem to be under the impression that tech debt is synonymous with bugs that users experience, and have no real comprehension on what the implications of the word actually is, which is most definitely not anything to do with a user in any capacity. Ultimately, its a conversation that leads you to write a review like this, because you can’t fathom how people are in this level of power with such little understanding of their actual field. To put it succinctly, It feels like I’m in an intellectual fun house when I speak to people above me, and it will for you too.
 The code bases are unkempt, and there is no oversight to it at all. Its a free for all. a wild west situation if you will. My manager (still not sure what he actual does other than gets yelled at by his bosses?) cant code, and never looks in the code base, so its up to us to police ourselves, or just accept the fate of complete anarchy. There is no documentation. There are no tests. And no one has any idea who is in charge of anything, ever. Trying to get an answer to anything is an entire day wasted. It is a bureaucracy at its finest. Everyone is trying to save their own hide, and no one has any interest in making this place function better at all. I abhor this place with a seething passion, but hey, it pays well if you know how to negotiate salary.
Also there is no flexibility in your hours. you are a 9-5 through and through. And they have this arbitrary expectation for people to go back to the office. So they will probably only hire you if you agree to move to the middle of nowhere.] =",excellent,excellent,good

[pros: Beautiful office & grounds
Free parking
Onsite restaurant, gym and showers
Frequent social activities
Training & development opportunities
Opportunities for progression
It's great to work in the education sector
Life in entry-level / junior roles avoids the politics, so must people at this level have a high opinion of the company & a great experience. As soon as you rise up the ranks, the ugly office politics became a constant obstacle and hindrance to getting anything done. (see Cons...)
cons: It was the best of times and the worst of times! Met some of the most wonderful people that I'm still good friends with now. I had training and development invested in me which enabled me to progress to a senior position. However, senior management & executive were often narcissists who made decisions to further their own careers which sometimes included hamstringing a project / or departmental venture so that their own embryonic business ventures could flourish once they left. This happened time & time again but if you dared mentioned your beliefs, you would become tarred as paranoid or a naysayer.  There were so many restructures, it was hard to keep up with.  Sadly, there were large pay differences between staff in identical roles, this may have been rectified now.   Saying the right thing was rewarded more than doing the right thing and some people in management were nicely ""retired in place"", contributing very little but seemingly able to survive every annual restructure. CEO & Exec would make decisions that they themselves would not defend, instead sending their underlings to take the heat.   I was there a number of years but like so many of my peers, eventually succumbed to a restructure and was made redundant. There is new management in place now, so hopefully a bit more stability and common sense can be introduced. It really could be a brilliant place to work if everyone pulled together.] =",good,neutral,excellent

[pros: Nice, hardworking staff. Good with breaks.
cons: Horrible pay and management. I was hired in 2012 at the opening of a new store in California to be the framing manager. I was promised 9.60 an hour (which is terrible but I was in college). I worked with the rest of the team for a month to get the store ready. While my job was secure, it was clear that the 100 plus people they had hired to set up the store were being misled into thinking there would be a job for them after the set-up was complete. The management fired most of them, a lot didn't even know they were let go (I remember one woman coming in with her kids and trying to use her discount and being told at the register she no longer worked there). At the end of the set-up and grand opening, less than 3 employees were kept on, the rest came over from the original store in the area that had been closed. I felt awful being a part of a company that would do that to so many people. I was paid 8.50 for the 6 months I worked there, despite repeatedly telling management that I was promised more. I was a full time store manager making about $300 a week. They were super strict about overtime (I.E. you won't be getting any EVER) and keeping employees under 40/week. Had to quit after months of being misled.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

Senior Management are not approachable, there is a lack of training and investment in employees which does not make for an engaged workforce. Always lots of projects to make improvements and simplify processes - but never give real world resolutions. 
More interested in building a fancy new head office then investing in employees, customers or fixing their finances. 
Not a bad company to work for, but if you want to progress in your career you're probably better looking elsewhere!] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: Good factory discount, nice office environment as long as you do not have to visit factories.  Generally the atmospher is relatively laid back.  A few people on the team due the bulk of the heavy lifting and many others can coast for years.  Many senior level employees are retired in place enjoying having a job while the company slowly declines.  HR tried to attract good employees and the benefits are decent for Toledo.  If you are looking at a short term gig to get experience, less than 2 years or so it might be a place to consider before leaving Toledo for good.
cons: The Company is doing poorly.  The stock price just hit a 52 week low.  Competition is fierce from overseas.  Senior management is clueless on what to do next.  The company is massively leveraged in debt.  Oil prices and natural gas prices are knocking the wind out of any hopes for a profitable year.  Goal sharing although in place pays out very seldom and no where near the maximum.  Senior management thinks it can beat the market by becoming Chinese.  Will soon move all production out of USA due to labor prices.  This company has hits its prime and now fill go from mediocre to death.] =",neutral,neutral,bad

[pros: maybe the slight work/life balance, except for  restricting the ability to take vacating to certain times of the year
cons: senior and middle management is horrible, the absolute worst i have ever dealt with in my years of corporate work - has absolutely no relationship with the rest of the employees and doesn't make any effort to create one. there is a complete lack of focus as to the direction of this company. management seems to have a vested interest in maintaining the current status quo, so there is a lack of respect for the rest of the employees. management actually yells and threatens employees with losing their jobs, how incredibly unprofessional. Very condescending. Lack of trust. Lots of gossip. management rules through fear and intimidation. Rest of staff is treated like children. I was told from the get go that it would be my responsibility to figure out what training I needed, there is NONE provided. No HR on site. Couldn't wait to leave.

Brand recognition is completely lost, with the loss of the Unisource Worldwide name and recent merger, causing a lot of customer confusion. There is no training on products and services, so you have no idea what brands or products are represented. 

This is a ""newly formed company"" which essentially arose from a merger of two companies and made its IPO this year. Extremely high turnover for many obvious reasons. There is a complete disconnect between senior management and the rest of the organization. No training for new hires. Never received any information regarding the health insurance plan or the 401K plan during my time there. All new employees are granted a standard amount of vacation days, instead of vacation time based on years of service, including external candidates with extensive years of experience. HR is a complete mess, no one in the HR group seems to know what they are doing. Employees are only paid on a monthly basis. No tuition reimbursement. Very bare benefits, with a focus on cost cutting. There is a limited number of sick days provided, which is highly unrealistic. Lots of employees seem to lack drive and morale to succeed beyond what is expected of them, which isn't surprising given the lack of involvement and leadership.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: The everyday person is typically great. About 65% to 70% of management is nice. The executives are great all around. There is room for diversity and engagement activities. I was given the freedom to be a top performer for 3 years until recently.

[pros: - good benefits (e.g. private insurance with vitality), good (corporate) discounts in London
- some nice colleagues (though in my opinion, smart people leave quickly - high employee turnover)
- modern office with free snacks and drinks
- great summer parties
- it looks good on a CV 
- the company is successful mainly due to the network effect, its products are rooted in the operations of financial institutions so it seems to me that Bloomberg will stay profitable for now
cons: - micromanagement culture, no flexibility (little flexibility with wfh, working hours, ways of working), old-schooled non-innovative practices, it feels like a very American corporate culture
- long working hours. they claim it's normal for the financial industry however, the salaries are not as high as in finance. Looking from the financial industry point of view: working hours okay but low salary; looking from non-finance related industries: long working hours but okay salary - though if you calculate per hour value, it is relatively low
- a very process-oriented company with very few innovations
- claimed to be flat structured, in reality very hierarchical, your seniority and contacts/politics matter a lot, if you are young/new you are expected to smile and do whatever you are told by your manager/older peers without questioning it, critical and outside of the box thinking is not appreciated. in my opinion little respect for people on entry or not-senior level positions
- internal politics and contacts matter more than your work results and knowledge 
- career progression depends on your manager, if they like you, you are lucky. your aspirations on the career path have little importance, the business need is of utmost importance
- to me, it seems like there is high employee turnover and that some teams operate in a very toxic way, it sometimes felt suffocating 
- culture of Bloomberg-praising, if you speak loudly and positively of Bloomberg you'll be noticed. in my opinion, it feels almost like daily Bloomberg propaganda
- you learn in your first 1 or 2 years, later the skills and work techniques are very Bloomberg specific, hence not transferable to other jobs and industries (even basic softwares like Outlook, Teams, slack are not used at Bloomberg, instead they have their own ones)] =",neutral,neutral,good

[pros: Monthly Bonus constructed from performance and accuracy. Extra incentives from being recognized as employee of the month as well as attendance bonuses for coming to work on time consecutively for an extended period of time. Health, dental and vision after 3 months of employment.
cons: Points towards attendance for any absence which includes sickness for a day with a doctors note. Unprofessional management makes up rules that are not documented in the employee handbook. Training is so unprofessional and improperly structured to the extent that management expects employees that do not get paid the pay grade of a trainer to train new hires instead of taking that role upon themselves. My shift was once told by the Senior Supervisor that he was sick of our attitudes (the actual words he used were much worse) and if our coworkers came to him about anyone complaining it could and most likely would lead up to our termination. Only 2 employees out of over 100 allowed time off per shift (1st and 2nd). Anyone that has personal issues arising whether it be kids, sickness etc. are subject to points towards attendance for being late. EXCESSIVE OVERTIME ranging from 10 hr - 12 hr shifts per day. This company inhibits a ""what have you done for me today"" attitude. Employees do whatever their told and put in so much time for this company to be treated as if their opinions, health and personal lives are not important whatsoever.

[pros: - A lot of holidays.
- How they decide your salary is clear - based on your age and how long you've been with the company.
- People are generally nice.
- You might get to participate in large construction & infrastructure projects both within and outside Japan.
cons: - Very conservative, sometimes to the horrifying level. E.g. If you're in a company dorm you are not allowed to bring a person of opposite sex in, you have to push a button when you come home = you get into a trouble if you stay out all night without prior notice, etc. But if you want to live on your own it's very expensive to do so in Tokyo as there's no compensation, and also difficult for non-Japanese citizens (no company support for paperworks etc.).
- They have no idea what to do with ""internationals"". They hire non-Japanese and overseas-educated Japanese but those recruits keep leaving within a couple of years because they are often put into positions where their skills (languages, previous work experiences) are completely wasted. 
- The pay is low until you get older - 40, maybe.
- Very inefficient work-flow. You need a lot of stamps to get your work done. Other divisions within the group often use their own IT systems that do not necessarily work with others' systems, which makes it very difficult to get things done more efficiently.

[pros: DXC is coming out the other side of a turbulent few years in which it was perceived as a bit of a badly behaved teenager. Since the new CEO joined there has obviously been some difficult decisions taken to correct that image and reboot the brand and culture. There is a genuine feel of a startup business that is looking for it's soul and purpose again as it re aligns itself to a new dawn of global integrators. I just hope that continues and that the values it speaks to are not shallow. Nothing is perfect of course, but the focus on doing the right thing, delivering quality services certainly resonates and will attract and retain the best people. DXC do some excellent things in the market and just need to shake off the legacy perception of tactical bad actors in this competitive market. It takes time though and most people in DXC want to keep driving the right ways of doing good business. It is also striving toward simplification of it's service offerings which is ambitious and makes complete sense in a more complex technological world.

Great co-workers and teammates 
No day is the same
Flexible on hours/start time. If you want to work a different time zone's hours, this is typically doable.
cons: Frustrated customers and contractors 
There is no work-life balance. If you want to keep on top of things, expect to spend weekend time checking emails and your phone
Contractors will finish a job and spend weeks trying to get paid because of unnecessary audits that are redundant 
Upper management does not care to hear suggestions on ways to improve processes
Improvement plans are a constant threat weighing on top of your head, and when you are on one and graduate out of it, they will turn back on their word
Cut-throat gossip is commonplace and I know things about other team members that I have no business being in the know of. 
Homeowners can be paired with bad contractors and there is no standard in escalations as to how to handle issues, and 9 times out of 10 the project manager/advisor is stuck having to assist when there should be upper management involved.
Managers have been hired with little to no industry experience

[pros: Probably the best thing about this place is the people you will work with. Not your manager, maybe the pharmacist, but mostly the little people like your photo tech, the cashiers, and shift leads. The different personalities will be the only thing you have to look forward to when you come to work. They are the only people that will equally suffer with you until you all graduate and get better jobs. Benefits are decent.
cons: Where to start. Let's start with the bum manager you will most likely have. I probably went through at least 10 store managers and only 2 we're decent human beings who genuinely cared for you and your colleagues. The other bunch, they don't show up and dump everything on you, they don't care about work life balance, and they'll make your life a living hell if you say anything or talk back. One manager even outed a friend of mine to their parents because of a speculation. One manager always had an excuse to not be there. He would never show up yet makes 3x my salary. But when he did, he would watch us bust our backs to get truck out in a night with limited staff and not do any work. Another one would pull out a work cart from the back, get herself all ready to do massive reset, only to have me or another lead do it because it was time for her to go home. 

Work-life? Yeah right. It took me getting into a corporate job to realize that it's OKAY to take a personal day. That it's OKAY to get sick. At Walgreens, they'll guilt trip you into showing up sick or make you feel bad because it's such an inconvenience that you're out. How dare you get sick and force the manager to do some actual work? Clopens. What are those? That's when you get stuck closing until 10pm or sometimes midnight and then you have to open the next morning at 7am. Those are worst. Talk to your manager? Waste of time. 

DM also doesn't help. They seldom, if ever, address your concerns. All they care about is if the store looks good. Have a ton of outs because people keep stealing things and your boss won't order alpha keepers because they're too expensive? Try explaining that to the DM only to hear ""I don't care. Put it out on the floor."" Ok. It all gets wiped next morning. Toxic work culture, toxic management.] =",neutral,bad,bad

[pros: This really is a company that is unlike any other - Opportunity abounds if you're in the right areas and can ""add value"" to the enterprise as a whole. Work/Life balance is exemplary and the total compensation packages are good IF you were hired before the pension was cut off. Stock options are ok but not in the same league that they were a few years ago. They're nice to have but they're not life changers anymore.
cons: Internal politics rule. It doesn't matter how much revenue you make for IHS, if your face doesn't fit with your current boss then you're done in the next lay off round. Unbelievably bad revenue recognition / tracking within the internal process. It's possible to absorb 100% of cost and be credited with 0% revenue when working across the business - this leads to culling people who make a difference while retaining deadwood.

[pros: Note: Other groups in Technicolor are not like this. M-GO is it's own entity within and at the same time apart from Technicolor.
The SoCal weather is nice. 
Easy, convenient walk to restaurants in downtown Burbank.
Other than that none. Zero. Zip. Nada. Nichts.
cons: M-GO was voted the most dysfunctional place ever worked at by myself and every co-worker I asked while I worked there.
Blame game / throw others under the bus culture. From original CTO to Technical Director to Development Management, all constantly blame the Engineers and those ""beneath"" them in the hierarchy for failures, but none of them offer solutions. Anyone who does try to fix the problems end up being targets for blame and eventual termination.
Overly hierarchical.
Content industry mentality sees Engineers as simple day laborers who have little value and whose jobs can be outsourced, insourced, or terminated upon completion of short term usefulness or for any other reason.
Over-reliance on H1 Engineers.
Constant reverse evolution of talented employees. Anyone with any skill, talent, or lots of engineering/industry experience eventually end up leaving or being terminated (unless they are H1 since their salaries are less and they will work the long hours required without complaint).
Constant ""crunch time"" work environment. Product has been in Beta release stage for a long time.
Product changes of direction by Executives and Technical Leaders have led to years of Beta release stage environment.
No respect or understanding for worker burnout.
Insanely bad management of people in almost every aspect.
Development Management refuse to (or are ignorant of) basic Engineering Industry standards so dev environments and all other environments are constantly changing, crashing and hard to keep afloat.
Extreme lack of long term or even mid term technical/engineering vision. Fix Bug Now! mentality pervades and with so little planning leads to constant rework and brittleness of systems.
Both Dev and QA teams are understaffed and overworked.

[pros: The only things that were okay about this job were the video trainings and the uniform.
cons: The pressure to sell protection plans here was just too much, and if you weren't adding a rewards phone number to like 90% of customers you took for the day (either with them being an existing rewards member or signing them up), the management would start complaining and saying you weren't doing well enough even on your first week. The protection plans were often pretty impossible to sell, where they'd ask you to make customers add a plan to their purchase of a kid's calculator that cost like $2 to begin with, or add a plan to a medium priced item that cost more than the item itself. They made us ask so many times at the register to the point that customers would be visibly upset, yet they'd also complain if we didn't ask every customer to complete our satisfaction with service survey at the end or if they gave a bad review (because we pressured them on said protection plans). The atmosphere was horrible, managers were rude and didn't do their jobs, even same rank coworkers were often snarky and trying to act like they were your boss. I don't know if it was just my location or not but I really wouldn't recommend this job to anyone with the way it was. They also were always short staffed so your schedule was not aligned to the hours you agreed upon when hired, and they had retail sales and tech sales associates cleaning the bathrooms.] =",bad,terrible,terrible

2. Compensation and bonuses are far less than satisfying.
3. Proper assignment of projects is not done.
4. Lack of good development projects. Mostly support and maintenance projects are available which do not give you very good exposure to learning a new technology from scratch.] =",terrible,bad,bad

[pros: Known international financial services brand
cons: Behind all the fancy slogans and brand name, SCB Kenya is a disgrace to the global brand and reputation of this financial services company. SCB encourages an extremely rude and demoralizing style of management especially in retail banking. Workplace bullying is commonplace.  Speak to the relationship managers and you will be told about repeated incidents and patterns of behavior intended to intimidate, offend, degrade or humiliate colleagues, all in the guise of bringing in clients and increasing ""numbers'. It is an extremely unprofessional culture and a shame to SCB globally. Colleagues come to work and are demoralized because of the verbal abuse suffered at the hands of managers and heads of retail.

[pros: 1. You tend to meet like-minded individuals because they are most likely from the same age group, and with the same education background. I was lucky to have made good friends here. 
2. Good training ground if you aspire to go far in financial accounting/internal audit/financial analyst
3. Learning is very structured -- company has training sessions but most of the time you learn from seniors, managers and partners on the job when they review your work
cons: Big 4s are known for their notoriously long hours but the hours at EY is getting from bad to worse.

[pros: This is a company that cares about it's employees.  Employees are treated as people instead of ""a number""  and our HR department is open and ready to come to the aid of those who need it.  The work load is manageable, the goals achievable, and the expectations are reasonable.   With everything going on in the world of finance these days, a company that continues to fund a softball team, builds a gym for its employees, continues to provide a matching 401K, and 40 hours of community service to it's employees is unique and refreshing these days.
cons: The salaries are definitely lower than industry standard,  so the trade-off is money for quality of life.  Also, and perhaps this happens in small companies often, not sure...there does tend to be a lot more gossip than I would have expected on a small group of people.  I find that distracting, unproductive, and quite frankly frustrating.   To be fair though, I don't know if that is the case throughout the company or just in my department.] =",bad,neutral,bad

[pros: Stackable employee discounts. Hours can be flexible and negotiated. Many opportunities for charity work and decent prices. Running out of nice things to say.
cons: Low pay, lower than minimum wage for part time associates, and employees discouraged about talking about pay to other employees (some will make more that you for less work). Part time employees will take forever to advance, if at all, and will usually work full time hours but remain on a part time payroll to avoid increased pay and/or benifits. Training is more of a baptism of fire than anything, leaving new associates to fend for themselves and gave to constantly ask questions, making staff appear uninformed and inexperienced. The ""yes we can"" is a gateway for dishonest customers, where employees are encouraged to make loopholes for customers and give undeserving discounts and strongly encourage customers to take the store survey with all answers marked ""highly satisfied"". Credit is pressured at almost unrealistic levels, making you feel incompetent in not meeting your goals because a customer doesn't want two accounts or they didn't like the inadequate explanation most employees are only able to give. Hard work is hardly recognised unless a corporate visit is scheduled, then management will make a big effort in making the store appear to look good on all fronts and revert back to how it usually is when the big-wigs leave. The idea of the Kohl's ""team"" or ""family"" is laughable, since the environment employees work in is geared towards turning those around you into scapegoats if your duties weren't finished. The lax attitude management has for customer dishonesty makes it all the more frustrating for employees to keep to company policy, and is a breeding ground for theft and shoplifters. There have also been several incidents where shift managers would mark employees for taking lunches and breaks when they actually hadn't, some working 8 or 9 hour shifts with no stop just to meet results. The only thing this company cares about is its bottom line, and it hides it behind faux smiles of  ""teamwork"" and overly glorified on ""#lifeatkohls"".] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: Interesting,  great experience. Paid training & qualification of Cert.3 in Contact Centre from Franklyn Institute. Uncapped bonus structure bases on kpi/metric performance mix of call handling time, core unit sales, secondary unit sales, customer transaction surveys (% of callers who do survey & their score of you)
cons: Some of the performance metrics aren't fair as they are dependent on customers choosing to do something they may not want to do after being on hold for an hour..like a survey about how nice you were & someimes people talk & talk & talk - but you can't be rude or tell them you have to go, just put up with it.. The pay is a 80/20 split which means you get guaranteed 80% pay each fortnight, and once a month, if you meet your KPI's to a certain level, that will unlock the remaining 20%..so when you for example exceeded your targets by 100%, you will receive 100% of your monthly income, if you get 30%, then you get paid the 20% balance of your salary, plus 10% extra of what you earn in a month (the scorecards are monthly)] =",good,good,bad

[pros: Some of the best and brightest employees, at least till they wise up and move on. Health benefits one of the top of the line. WFH
cons: Genesys preaches ""empathy"", but doesn't practice. No reward for being a loyal employee. New hires are paid at the same rate of someone that has been around 10+ years. Completely kills any and all culture when buy out other companies. So glad TB can encourage employees to take time off from his 2nd Montana home, while ""raises"" are less than SSA COLA. But hey they'll send you a cabinet full of coffee cups. If you are a new hire, sure, absolutely apply and learn from some the best with industry leading technology. But be ready to move on after a few years because you will be underpaid and undervalued. Soak up everything you can and run for the hills. In efforts to be up to date on culture, also be prepared to be passed over for any sort of promotion or recognition if you identify as any majority, no matter how hard you work. While it is well documented and an atrocity in business as whole minorities are undervalued, Genesys has made a concerted effort to ""fix"" their statistics by undeserved promotions. Also if you are a VP, great place to apply as there are about 500 VPs. Bad place to be if you are a worker, but great if you are a manager with your golden parachute.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent
