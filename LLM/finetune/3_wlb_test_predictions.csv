[pros: Nothing about this place is good.
cons: This is a legal pyramid scheme where you only move up the ladder by selling products. Not by how hard you work. They pay you $14 an hour to work 11 hour days.

[pros: GE Energy goes out of its way to assure a fair and equitable work environment.  Like most large organizations there is a big focus on fully complying with all laws and business best practices.  The company is growing opening up many opportunites for career advancement and GE does appear to work hard to develop its own workforce and promote from within.
cons: GE Energy is an organization chasing the ""Smart Grid"" brass ring and is growing too quickly to be truly effective.  This is a very process-oriented organization and although some of the processes improve the overall success of the programs, there are many that don't.  There is too much time required for inane training - a never ending cycle of ""required"" courses - most of which are not related to an individual's job function.] =",good,good,bad

[pros: - You gain a lot of knowledge, quickly. They will throw a lot of work at you, so if you're ready to learn, you will do so quickly.
- A lot of great people to work with. Although some of my managers were far better than others, I tended to really enjoy the people there and thought they meant well in the end.
cons: - They don't really care about your goals to grow within the company, only what they would like to see you take on. I was considered a high performer, yet was stuck in my department because upper management didn't want to see talent move to a different area.
- Will work you to the bone. Not really great at providing a work-life balance.
- Company is not doing well right now, and it shows in the stress levels of everyone there. High stress, high pressure. When business is bad, the morale suffers (makes sense, but no a very enjoyable environment to walk into every day).] =",terrible,bad,excellent

[pros: Decent customers, work was ok, new things happen a lot.  The name looks great on a resume.  There really aren’t too many.

[pros: + Good Salary
+ Good Company to have on your resume
+ Great Management experience 
+ Nice discount especially on groceries
+ Rotating weekend & week schedule is better than most other retailers
+ Good 401K / pension package
cons: - Attractive salary to new graduates but realize that most of your time is spent on the salesfloor doing manual labor.  Think about your future career goals, and don't be lured by the high salary because in this economy it's hard to move into another industry after working a long time period in retail management.  The high salary will not compensate for the number of hours that you are working.
- Extremely long hours, plan on at minimum 50 hours but realistically it's closer to 60-65 hours for an average week, 70 hours for holiday/peak weeks.  In addition, you will be doing leadership tasks (paperwork, email etc.) from home.
-50% of the time is supposed to be spent on leadership tasks but you will end up spending at least 70% of your time doing manual labor.   It's nearly impossible to meet all standards and expectations especially in a low volume store with the amount of payroll headquarters allocates without doing some of the team member's work.  Also if you aren't meeting sales you need to cut payroll by sending team members home or by cutting their shift.  YOU will be the one doing their job so your store can make that month's payroll and so all expectations are being met as you are being held accountable to leading your team to those high results.
- Not able to have time off during holidays and peak times.  Feel guilty when you take vacation time, never seems like there is a good time to take vacation.
- Performance is hardly considered in this position, it's your ability to speak to the business even if it's not the correct information.  
- Not enough recognition to those who know the business inside and out and run solid green areas.  You will not be valued/appreciated/looked at for promotions if you are solid at running your areas, it's your ability to ""speak.""
- Networking is a MUST to move up in the company, it has to be done on your own time or your day off.
- Team member expectations are exceptionally high especially for the amount of pay they earn and very small pay increases.
- Perception is everything, be prepared to be doing excellent at your job and receiving positive feedback but then maybe the next day, week or month your store team leader, district team leader will change and then you could be considered a bottom performer. 
- Health benefits are not the best compared to other employers.
- Poor work/life balance - position consumes your entire life.... forget having a family life and seeing much of your friends.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

Despite headwinds and crisis over the past few years, management and employees stay engaged in the mission because everyone really believes in the impact of what we do here.
cons: Ways of working are a little behind the curve, however, the company is well-aware and there are genuine efforts to upgrade technology and bring in new talent with diverse experience. The culture of kindness can sometimes get in the way of direct feedback and slow down progress, but this is also a known challenge that management is working to change.] =",neutral,excellent,excellent

[pros: Publix can be a very relaxed workplace, at least at the store I was working at. I know others can be much more strict. Overall the best part about working for Publix is the people you get to work with. You meet a lot of good people. And Publix gifts you stock as well.
cons: In recent years Publix has been seriously decreasing the number and value of benefits their workers, especially part-time workers, get. When compared to other employers of the same industry, Publix is shadowed by the starting pay and benefits of Target or Walmart even for part-time work. I have had it heard it said that if you are chasing $0.50, Publix is not for you, and I would say I agree with that. If you are willing to work for not enough money to support yourself or your family, Publix is perfect for you. The only way to truly do well with Publix is to pursue management positions, in which you can expect to work 50 hour work weeks regularly. I would also add that management who has been grandfathered into so many benefits will absolutely question why you would care about your pay so much.] =",good,neutral,excellent

[pros: Decent pay and good benefits. It's a very busy environment at times during the year. The winter is alot slower and overtime is kept to @40 hours if your lucky. Even forced to use 1,2,or 3 vacation days during specific months in the winter. Just do your job, do it well and you will not have any problems. It can be taxing, yes you can work 55+ hour weeks. But by helping the company out, you get to have a job making money. 
 If your just starting off in this field you will start on the low end around $13. But can be as high as $18 to start. It's a good job, everyday is different. I'm not sugarcoating but this job does have its issues, but than again what job out there doesn't?
cons: During the warmer months overtime can be high. During the winter months overtime is almost nonexistent, even forced to use your vacation time ( this is legal, I checked).
Communication is ok. Needs a lot more improvement on that end. 
And I honestly think the pay is a little under what it should be.] =",neutral,bad,excellent

[pros: The experience is good, and my fellow colleagues are among the brightest in the field.  
However, management in London is very aggressive about getting as much as possible from employees, while paying as little as possible.  For example, in 2007 they gave such bad annual salary increases, that they had to reverse their decision because they suddenly realised they would have huge numbers leaving the investment team because everybody was so disgruntled...we were all called in individually 2 weeks after the 1st annual salary review mtg and told 'good news, we've decided to increase your remuneration'.  Literally, every year the company decides how little they can get away with paying..they push their employees to complete disillusionment.  I have never worked in such a negative environment...most people I talk to are waiting for the market to pick up so that we can jump ship.
cons: A very aggressive managment style that has no regard for their employees.....msg is clearly given that we can be easily replaced because of what they regard as the 'strength of the brand'.   Annual reviews are conducted by mgmt in the manner of how little they can get away with paying, rather than rewarding performance.  They string you along that next time it will be better, but most people realise after being through the process 3-4 times, that this is a continued practice, promoted by the owners who demand an 18% or so margin from the business.  We've even had it explained to us that our bonuses are down because this margin of profit to the Johnson Family must be preserved!!  I find it hard to believe that the company can continue this mgmt strategy towards employees, as morale is so low.  Once they've destroyed the goodwill among employees....as I've seen happen over and over again, when people realise that the promise of reward for hard work and exceptional performance is only a carrot they dangle with no intention of delivering....it is almost impossible to rebuild.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: I can say Makro once had a bunch of good people in terms of the general staff. I wonder how they managed to recruit and keep them considering the regular problems with management emanating from a poor strategy (as stated below). 

Makro also had a good service idea, especially the HoReCa concept.
cons: From the time I worked at Makro, I noticed many problems with Makro service delivery, but none of the problems come close to the problem of constant change of top management, Not sure whether this happened across the company, but at the Cribbs Causeway branch the top management hardly lasted two years. Every year or two a new Store Manager would be brought in from elsewhere in the company while his assistant would be brought in from outside the company. To say the least, most times these two would often struggle to work together. I remember a time when a colleague was asked by the Store Manager to put a product on front end of an isle. When the Assistant Store Manager passed by and saw my colleague setting up the product, he immediately told him to stop and remove the product. When my colleague mentioned that the Store Manager had given the instruction, the Assistant Store Manager ignored that and still asked him to remove the product, of which my colleague obliged. When the Store Manager passed by and saw that what he had instructed had not been done, he asked my colleague why he had not yet done what he had asked him to do. When he mentioned the Assistant Store Manager's counter instruction, the Store Manager asked my colleague to 'just do' what he had asked him to do. While it may sound like an exaggeration to say that this went on for a greater part of the day, this actually did happen, and it actually happened between one of the most successful managers of the Cribbs Causeway branch and his assistant.] =",terrible,bad,none

[pros: The benefits offered are very good.

the teams are generally interested toward investing in the community.

Childcare (up to 240/month) and tuition reimbursements (undergrad 2600/yr; masters 5250/yr) are very attractive benefits.  However, you must reimburse BAC for masters tuition if you leave within 2 years of last reimbursement.
cons: The new hire training needs an excessive amount of work because new hires are essentially onboarded and then put on the computer for a minimum of 1 week, and up to 1 month depending on the position.

If you don't say things the way upper management wants you to say things they will obviously coach you (which is necessary and needed) but they will hold it against you for months and months anytime they see something that they don't agree with.

Promotions are few and far between because of the amount of hiring freezes, or team minimization.

Change is a necessary evil, but when the teams add something on as a non-negotiable, and then they don't follow-up, and then they give written warnings when it's not done properly isn't right.  But don't worry, that non-negotiable initiative will come and go anywhere from 2-5 times depending on the amount of change in your market team and which market manager likes whichever initiative.] =",good,neutral,excellent

[pros: Loved the values, loved the management in the district while I was there.  My district manager visited from time to time and was always focused on developing at getting the best out of the team by highlighting each individual person's strengths.  Always made me and everyone else on the team feel hopeful when things weren't looking great.
Love the products. 
Discount was great, before they started giving customers an even better discount 24/7.
cons: New corporate is the same old board with fresh faces - same problems, same tried and failed strategies, same absurd amount of promotions.  Was hopeful that things would turn around when they came on, but it's been more digging of the hole that the company appears it will never get out of.

New managers keeps coming into stores trying to reinvent the wheel, and ignoring the training guidelines that actually do work.  Company can't seem to set and stick to any expectations whatsoever, so that isn't really a surprise I suppose. 

Management now has a certain coaching style they need to adhere to, and I'm not sure if it's the style itself or if the managers aren't implementing it correctly, but there is no positive feedback, managers seem to ignore shortcomings of their favorite team members, and harp on and nitpick every little thing about the people they don't like.  It doesn't feel supportive anymore, and it seems like it's becoming more and more high pressure with absolutely no reward for employees who work hard to improve.] =",terrible,bad,excellent

[pros: Comradery and support of department staff.
cons: it was hard to leave position as I truly intended to be a 'lifer'.
When a current employee has concerns about the workplace the standard response from HR is to have the employee discuss issue w/their Manager. Why bother with employee surveys when you do not act on employee concerns, often Department specific? Senior Management does not care what the line staff cares/wants or needs. Seems they are more concerned about protecting their jobs and not challenging the current CEO (who if it was not for the overworked, unappreciated line staff would NOT HAVE A JOB). So Middle management treats exempt salaried staff as non-exempt hourly staff, never giving comp time for hours worked over 40 hours yet insist on 'work-life balance' when extreme work load is impossible to complete in 40 hours. Additionally, staff morale is the worst I have seen as the new management style is 'micromanagement'.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

cons: With so much change in the last several years, the business has been a hard place to work. I never truly felt like we were on an up swing during my time there. Leadership during this time was largely people who grew up in investment banking which made it frustrating at times. The business went through a potential sale and finally an internal merger with the wealth management business a couple years back and has a short timeline to turn the businesses around. Morale was low and fear was high when I was there. The business was very top heavy and cliquish which made it difficult for what little junior talent we had left to move up.] =",excellent,bad,bad

[pros: Cohu SEG is a challenging environment that is successfully competing in a global market. The company has a remarkable number of highly educated, experienced, motivated employees. Cohu offers above average benefits, competitive compensation. The company has a well established customer base and aggressively pursues opening new market opportunities. Historically, market share has expanded and should continue to expand as new products are introduced.
cons: Cohu SEG competes in the difficult semiconductor test industry which has changed from a specialty oriented market to a commodity oriented market over the past 10 years. This condition has influenced the management to try to run too lean and to off shore manufacturing operations. At the US operation, there are too few support workers for the number of managers. An overly complex one size fits all inflexible ERP tool was implemented in 2013 that remains incompatible with the needs of the engineering and manufacturing departments. Emphasis has been placed on initial product cost. Time to market has replaced quality as priority. Introduction of product features has replaced reliability as priority. Layoff and turnover rates have increased as a result.] =",bad,bad,excellent

[pros: Friendly company, lots of direct communication between upper management and the stores. Great opportunity for experience with customer service, and even learning about how clothing is tailored. The stores and workplace culture have a comfortable ambience. While you are encouraged to upsell and increase your numbers, the pressure is not very intense, and your co-workers will help you out when they can. You learn a LOT about formal clothing, and it's impossible to walk away from this job without being better prepared to dress and carry yourself for an interview at the next one. Corporate puts genuine effort into improving the company's diversity and sense of equality. They also go out of their way to do nice things for employees, like buying them food or organizing fun activities.
cons: When the company isn't doing well, the lowest paid retail employees suffer the most. 8 hours/week is the minimum they'll schedule part time associates for, and upper management has constantly been cutting the total employee hours allotted to each store recently, so part timers aren't making enough to get by. Even before COVID, they started cutting employee discounts and benefits. Schedules are unpredictable, not only for individual employees but the store hours themselves. Their sales promotions are also extremely complex and variable, sometimes changing every couple days. We are given steep sales goals while the company keeps dropping the product prices lower and lower, making them harder to meet. Training and communication can be kind of disoriented and inconsistent between different managers. This company has definitely become worse to work for in the past couple years, even though I still think the work environment is much better than most others.] =",excellent,neutral,excellent

[pros: GEA is a very diverse company in terms of both the products it makes, customer applications and cultures. I have had the privilege to have worked for GEA in different countries and companies. I can honestly say that it is an extremely fair company, they do care about employees, and they try to do the right thing. 

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend people to join GEA, but go in with eyes open, it is a large and sometimes slow organisation, you have to make it happen - its full of opportunity and great people, but you need to be a networker, and be able to push yourself through the organisation otherwise you could find yourself for 20+ years stuck in one place.

Recently set up matrix organisation is working much better than before, but you need to be able to work effectively in a matrix

GEA has some really good people in it - and you don't have to look hard to find them.
cons: Archaic IT infrastructure, and a real lack of people that understand how to use digital to drive customer experience. 

Lots of approval lines, unless you are the CEO of a division, you wont have any real power to decide things, everything is controlled in the center.

High pressure to deliver, and not a lot of thanks when you do - no particular employee benefits of note - other than the minimum.

It is not a 'fun' place to work, it is highly transactional, but you learn a lot at GEA and gives you room to grow.] =",neutral,neutral,excellent

-new office in Canary Wharf
-smart & friendly colleagues
cons: -the company's business and strategy is run from the US/Canada office therefore London seems always left aside

-very poor HR: no regular catch-up, no strategy to develop talents, always report to the managers i.e. do not create a safe space for employees
-senior management is regularly promoted and/or expands roles/teams compared to the younger staff

[pros: Internal systems were easy to use and everyone was very friendly and helpful.
cons: In my own opinion there were too many people involved in the management of a single employee. It could have been that I was only there temporarily and did a job that was new to them. But I would get calls from almost everyone in scheduling about substituting for people who were not able to work. This made me very confused when I did have an issue and was not sure who my contact person was. Also I didn't have regular check ins with anyone at Aveanna, which made it difficult when contracts with companies were ending and I only received a few days notice. Lastly, it also didn't seem like there was any consequences to people who called out multiple shifts in a row. They would also not take into consideration the time in between shifts, for example if you worked until 10 pm they would ask you to cover a shift the following morning at 4 am.] =",neutral,neutral,terrible

[pros: -Nice, knowledgeable people
-Caring employees
-Average health care benefits with no assistance to offset a large deductible on some plans. My previous employer supplemented 50% with no strings attached.
-Team environment
cons: -All white male executive leadership. Newsflash: C-level women really do exist!
-Cube farms are loud and disruptive. 
-No remote worker option unless granted permission. Working from home is very frowned upon.  Backward thinking if ""you're not at the office, you're not working.""
-ScanSource would rather spend money on expensive, flashy conferences and kickoffs than pay their employees well.
-ScanSource would rather spend money  sponsoring frivolous Nascar races than pay their employees fairly.
-Out of touch executives who actually think it's okay to rob employees of precious weekend family time to deliver content that could be done during business hours. No extra personal day awarded on already very skimpy vacation time. Shameful that a southern company doesn't at least award Martin Luther King day off.
-Corporate marketing structure is top heavy and inefficient.

[pros: Culture is king at Aduro, and I think the emphasis on culture will typically lead these reviews to either be very glowing or very negative. It's virtually impossible to be objective here, you either love the culture like I did or hate it, so with that out of the way, here are the pros:

- Dog, dogs, dogs
- Genuinely kind people
- No dress code, popular outfits often include exercise gear, yoga pants, but I've even seen kigurumi pajamas
- Unpretentious attitudes, anyone can schedule a meeting with anyone, even the CEO
- Flexible working hours for most jobs
- Unlimited PTO, this is a bit of a meme at most companies, but at Aduro some of us really put this to the test and never had issues taking 4 weeks a year or more
cons: I'm loath to address the words of someone who seems to hate the office dogs, but there's a negative review that mentions gift cards being awarded for 5-star reviews. I feel the need to clarify that this wasn't anything I was aware of, so it definitely wasn't a company-wide thing, but managers are given a lot of leeway and a small handful of particularly erratic people have been given the reins of power in the past.

cons: This is review for the telephone research center where you actually work in the building (TRC). The job in and of itself is tedious and monotonous, you make dozens of phone calls, get dozens answering machines, hang ups, and ill tempered respondents. On top of this there is a on site manager, a shift team supervisor, another online supervisor and a ""mentor"" which is actually just another overseer waiting to ponce on any mistake you make. Since I worked at night my ""mentor"" had a bad habit of wanting to call me during the daytime, when I had to be at another job, for issues and updates that could have easily been handled by e-mail. With the weekly monitoring of  phone calls, which I understand is necessary, the overall effect is like being in a cage with people watching you, ready to poke you with sticks at the slightest error.

[pros: -The people I worked with were nice and easy to get along with for the most part
-Hours and Work Life Balance are typically good, but there are some exceptions (see cons for more detail)
-Internal mobility is highly encouraged (and often the only way to be promoted)
-Good benefits (a huge focal point of management, often at the expense of compensation though)
-Easy to stand out as a top performer (but that is not guaranteed to be rewarded)
-A lot of opportunities to take on tasks/responsibilities outside the scope of your role (but once again, you are not guaranteed to be rewarded for doing so)
-The work itself is interesting. Credit Cards is a niche industry with a lot of unique nuances
cons: -The company is the definition of bureaucratic. Outdated technology is finally being addressed, but is still far away from being implemented
-Salaries are low compared to competitors (traditional banks and Fin Techs). Bonuses are insultingly low given the level of work/responsibilities for Pricing. Bonus Targets were increased slightly, but still far off from where they should be. Business Development constantly relies on Pricing to get deals done, yet we do not share in any of the upside they receive. HR is adamant they constantly monitor the market to remain competitive on compensation, but all their announced initiatives have done nothing to address the compensation gap
-Career advancement is a complete black hole. Promotion timelines are unclear and undefined. HR has promised they are looking to address this, but I do not have high hopes
-For 2022, the company only gave out 3% raises. While this may seem like a normal amount, it is insulting considering the company had a record year in 2021 and inflation was at its highest level since the 1980s
-The promotion process is extremely unfair and stacked against newer employees
-Communication from certain groups (especially Sales/Business Development) are often unclear and delayed, which creates unnecessarily tight deadlines and often require major revisions to the work product. There is a clear disconnect between Finance and Business Development that creates unnecessary tension and it does not appear that senior leaders are willing to actually address this issue
-The work can be very repetitive as senior leaders will ask for countless iterations on work products to arrive at attractive returns, even if it means submitting uncompetitive bids
-The company goes through re-orgs what seems like every year, creating uncertainty in some groups and constantly shifting the leadership structure of others
-The company has no clue what to do with Bread Pay and post-merger integration pains are continuing with no end in sight
-The Bread Financial and Alliance Data brand names carry very little weight. This can make things difficult when applying to jobs at different companies as most people have no clue what Alliance Data is or does (and they definitely don’t know what Bread Financial is)
-The company is fixated on controlling costs, which has led to reduced hiring as a way to not increase personnel expenses. As a result, employees are expected to take on a larger workload given the overly aggressive growth expectations communicated by executives, yet compensation remains relatively unchanged. The CFO was asked about compensation during a company-wide meeting and had a very negative reaction to being asked such a question, not a very promising sign…
-Median employee salary increased 18% from 2020 to 2021, yet merit raises were only 3% It appears leadership is more than willing to pay for external talent, but remains stingy with internal talent] =",good,neutral,good

[pros: evo recently added three months paid parental leave for their employees (a benefit that is not overly common in the industry.) I was granted the benefit just days before I was to go on my leave after having only been with the company for six months. I cannot begin to express my gratitude to the company and my team for the support that was given to me during this delicate and beautiful time in my life. Having this benefit as a first time parent was a heavy load lifted off my shoulders. I was able to focus my time bonding and welcoming my new baby into this world, my health and spending time with family and friends. I've recently returned back to a job I love for a company I love even more. The people are what makes this place so great. I am grateful and proud to be a part of something greater than myself. To say evo values family and community is an understatement.

[pros: Great training, commission potential can be very high if you are in the right division, Solid leadership. Lots of support with prospecting. The company does care about you and will develop you. They give you plenty of time to ramp up and learn the position. Outside of sales it is not uncommon to hear about employees that have been with the company for 10+ years.
cons: Disconnect between sales and operations which can lead to loosing sales. It's a constant grind and there is no reward for keeping clients happy longterm. Once you close the deal you will never see or speak to them again. You sell products specific to your division and cannont sell products from other divisions even if you have a buyer or can sell the product yourself you are forced to work with internal partners. Can be hit or miss here depending on who you get to work with. Good partners can lead to great business but the opposite is true as well and with the high turnover it can be a constant challenge.

[pros: Some coworkers at this location are good to work. Benefits are decent.
cons: The Toronto office has very poor management from the project level to department managers. Projects are always late and over budget. Numerous clients have stated that they will not work with Shaw again because of poor execution by Toronto office. 

The majority of  the Toronto ""Ivory Tower"" staff are lazy and technically incompetent. They are more concerned with their individual goals/salaries than the company or projects. 

Employees are treated like overheads and numbers. Hard-work, merit and performance are not considered during retention. Favoritism, friends and politics play an important role in the office especially during raises and lay-offs. 

There is NO training for junior engineers. Company policies are not followed by managers. Typically career length is 1-2 years till you are fired. High turnover in the last year (over 200 laid-off). 

Anyone considering working at Shaw’s Canadian office should consider contractor work not full-time status because chances of being laid off in 6-12 months is high.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: The general manager is a lovely woman when she wants to be but something doesn't go her way, you will see a different side of her. Sometimes you get breaks but it's very rare that you do, especially for managers. The customers were great and loved how we had regulars. You are always asked to work your hardest but the pay doesn't match it. I threatened to leave if I didn't get a raise and I didn't even get the raise I asked for. Overall, the job and customers were nice but management could be a lot better. Management need to be a team at the end of the day.

[pros: Loads of learning experiences - but related to your role and for your personal development. I have always felt the company has great principles and really looks out of it's employees. There is plenty of room for advancement and the compensation/benefits are amazing.
cons: The wrong people are in management opportunities more often than they should be. While their are opportunities for advancement and promotion - many managers would rather place their ""buddies"" in new roles, even if they have no experience. Opportunities are also given to the same 4-5 people in a department, but everyone is held to their expectations to produce results when they are not given an opportunity to do so.] =",neutral,excellent,bad

[pros: I enjoyed my first year at DCRI working with some very bright individuals with great ideas. Able to work remotely to some extent.  Educational opportunities, however it needs to be very specific to position. Having said that, it has been more difficult to get approval for trainings due to DCRIs current financial situation.
cons: Over the last several months, my opinion of DCRI has completely changed. While I have enjoyed the idea of working at a place attempting to be 'innovative', I think DCRI has a long way to go before they can claim this label. The projects seem chaotic in an industry where planning and execution are critical. Most Project Leaders I have work with do not lead, they manage by intimidation or they are simply not present with their project team. I suppose it may be a lack of training, tools,  resources, etc, but in my experience this is one of the worst places I have experienced for project leadership.  

There seems to be a lot of distrust between staff and management in general right now, likely due to the recent RIF. That may be challenging for DCRI to get past, given how long that process took place, and how the working environment was allowed to spiral downward for so long.] =",neutral,bad,terrible

[pros: Great pay and good benefits. If you don't want to work hard and get by then this is the place for you.
cons: Smoking in the building in all hallways. Changed room titles from conference rooms to training rooms to allow smoking. Smoking eclipse heat not burn cigarettes reek worse than real cigarettes and smell like wet smoldering paper. 85% of everyone in a meeting is smoking and by the end you are in a cloud and hardly able to find the door. You go home smelling like smoke everyday. You don't feel like you are contributing to the well being of society because your focus is to produce a product that provides nothing to the users but health issues. You are there for only a pay check. Upon interviewing for future positions outside of Reynolds you are told ""I hope you don't think this will be like Reynolds where you can just sit on your butt half the day and get paid"".
Also tribal knowledge is a real problem and the only people that can really contribute are lifers in the industry. It will take years for anyone to get up to speed on all the aspects of the industry. This industry is only alive because of taxes it generates. If the taxes are ever lost then this industry will be history. History just like what it feels like when you walk through the doors to work everyday like stepping back in time in an episode of Mad Men. 
If you find yourself on the unpopular or blacklist then they will work with HR to find anything they can to get rid of you and deny unemployment benefits.
I did not find that I had a purpose in life while working here and was just buying time until I found a real fulfilling job to contribute to the well being of society. If you just want a fat paycheck and annual bonus and don't care if you just get by then this is the place for you. If you want to actually contribute to the future and build a promising future for your kids and grand children then if they offer you a job run like hell.] =",neutral,terrible,terrible

[pros: Upper management is wonderful.  District and Regional managers really care about employees.  I was approached for a promotion after only a year within the company.  I have witnessed upper management go to bat to keep employees within the company, or to help them keep employment when moving out of state.  Lots of room for advancement.  Competitive salary.  Awesome benefits and great programs to help assess health and lower the cost of benefits even more.  Generous PTO and vacation purchase programs.
cons: Branch assistance is minimal.  It is not for lack of trying; the company just doesn't have enough staff to support.  Often times, I have been left with one other person to run a branch for a week.  This, of course, creates client frustration, and the employees take the brunt of that.  Hold times on technology support phone lines are often times 5-6 hours.  This lack of support creates high turnover.  It is difficult to get new hires into the appropriate classes, (sometimes over a month-long wait, which means that it takes 2 months from hire to truly have the employee up and running), which further adds to the issue.] =",bad,good,excellent

2. Bonus will be given in splits, 50% in oct and 50% in March. Also if you resign before Oct, you will not get any bonus for the year you have worked day and night. So initially in offer letter they will mention bonus as part of pay but if you resign before oct 31st, no bonus will be paid.
3. Notice period is “3 months”. When you resign, no communication will be given regarding your last working day even after multiple follow-ups. And suddenly one day HR will wake up and tell you that your last working day is after let's say 15 days. So on paper notice period is 3 months, which is already unusual, but your ""actual"" notice period will be decided by HR (which can be anything 20 days, 1 month or 3 months) and communicated to you when HR feels good (Like I said they will email you generally 15 days prior to last working day). 
4. Please note that if you resign after oct (let’s say Nov 1) then you will be relieved only after April of next year i.e notice period of ""insane 6 months"".
5. After your last working day, be prepared to make multiple follow-up's for experience letter. HR team don't even respond to background verification email from the new employer.
6. Very high employee attrition rate. 
7. Forget your life in busy season. It will be work and only work and even after busy season if you are plotted on a big client then you will have to work insanely even after busy season.
8. Since you would be working on US clients, expect you will have to work late night in busy season.
9. Most important, there will always be a fear that you would be removed from the firm as in the midst of pandemic the firm fired many employees without proper reason.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: The hours are great for those in school as the hours are later in the evening. The lane servers are paid $8 an hour plus tips, for now anyway.
cons: The facility I work at is old, falling apart, and infested with roaches, not to mention mold growing in the nozzles of the drink machine. Management only seems to care about their bonus. They have informed them of the roach problem numerous times with no results. There are no benefits, most of the time it is less than 30 hours a week. They tell you you will get party pay for working parties and they charge an 18% ""Administrative Fee"" to all parties that order food in the contract. I have seen these fees as high as $750 (in addition to the regular amount of the package) and when I get my check stub my portion of the ""Party Pay"" is $9 (customers think this includes the gratuity but it does not...therefore they do not leave a tip). They refuse to fully staff and expect one person to wait on 40 lanes, one person to wait on as well as cook all the food for the customers that go directly to the Snack bar. They have one experienced Bartender and the ones that fill in are inexperienced and sometimes it gets backed up in the bar. When this happens I have to stop lane serving and help in the bar. The clientele is horrendous. Nasty attitudes, filthy, animal like eating habits (chicken bones left on the floors, Nachos ground into the carpet, spilled drinks, condiments intentionally smeared on the tables, toilets not flushed),and they are poor tippers (yet they expect 5 star service). The company use to have a cleaning crew that came in every night to sweep, mop, buff the floors, vacuum,  clean the bathrooms, and wash the windows. They stopped that service and gave it to the over worked, under paid regular employees. They have no incentive programs such as Employee of the Month, Top Sales, or anything else. They take, take take from the hard working employees and expect ""World class service"".] =",neutral,terrible,bad

[pros: Unfortunately, not many left now to recommend.
cons: - Started off well but went downhill soon after the take over from Blackstone - Roles are significantly under paid - Enabling bad behaviour and allowing some people to take advantage of poor or inexperienced management - Rolling door of staff (particularly in Sales) - Tagline of Safety is number one priority when in fact it's all about saving and making money - Lack of support when trying to work to agreed processes or procedures - Over reliance on single people in different teams which causes problems when one person leaves or goes on long term sickness Special mention of the current CEO Sarwjit Sambhi who appears to have only been installed to oversee the takeover of St. Modwen and the subsequent asset stripping of the ""less valuable"" pieces of the business (e.g St. Modwen Homes). This man is pleasant enough and appears to have an open door policy (on the face of it) however must take some of the responsibility for not listening to concerns and guilty of either burying his head in the sand or deliberately allowing a good business to fail.

Lots of higher ups have worked at other companies before, so it's great to be able to speak with people who have very diverse backgrounds.

[pros: I worked while I was in high school. They were pretty understanding about taking days off (as long as it was 2 weeks in advance) and working around your schedule. There was also an option for me to be moved up to cashier after a while of doing good work as a courtesy clerk. The managers loved a good worker who showed up on time, didn't complain, and got their job done.
cons: I often times felt over worked and underpaid. Things done in my job description included getting carts off the lot, sweeping the entire store floor, bagging, cleaning restrooms, and emptying all store trash cans. If they were under-staffed we were still required to bag but also we had to make sure to get our allotted store sweeps and periodic bathroom checks in. It was simple work as a high schooler but it soon became old and I stopped looking forward to going to work.] =",good,bad,bad

[pros: Employee rate in luxury hotels....when available
cons: You are a number. End of the story. Working here will end in you being burned out, belittled, bullied depending who your manager is. Don't try to report to HR, if you're lucky they will just smile and tell you to take a few days off. Otherwise,  anything happening is your fault because you misunderstood (obviously being a non native speaker has its perk to cover bullying). No career progression, unless you know the right person and smile. Thinking out of the box is not allowed or even considered a skill. You do what you've been asked, no question. God forbid you suggest an easier, more efficient way to complete a task. Nobody knows who does what.

They tell you when you get hired that 50% of your time should be spent working on leadership duties but in my store ETL's spend about 90% of our time doing task work like cashiering, pushing carts, flowing the truck because we don't have enough payroll to be properly staffed. They also wouldn't tell me what store I would be in when I got hired until I was done with business college. I have a very long commute and work in a high crime rate area.

[pros: Some of the people that you will meet at work and through work are amazing.
Now, I can work partially at home.
cons: The pay is terrible and what's worse is that everyone assumes that you work for apple so you are set. Not that in order to cover my extremely modest and minimal lifestyle I either need to live in an unsavory part of town, have roommates even though I'm well into my 40s, or get yet another job on what limited time I have.
Also higher ups push the culture down your throat, but in the same breath will say, ""well we are a business"" to justify some shady process.
Apple is like any other multi billion dollar company, at the end of the say its about the bottom line and it will always be profits over people.] =",terrible,bad,bad

The problem is that the hiring strategy isn't really focused on hiring excellent managers, but on promoting top performers - who may or may not be great leaders. Additionally, Wells Fargo does a bad job of allowing an employee to expand their interest or go beyond their very specific tasks.

Way to much time is spent in appearances and group politics and less of getting ""creative"" and ""strategic"" work done.

[pros: - Sometimes there are free snacks in the breakroom.
- The dress code is decent; generally, you can wear as you want (no uniform).
cons: - The pay is minimum wage or just a few cents above for coordinators.
- The hours get excruciatingly low after the holidays, which shows just how little they care about their workers (their little play-things).
- New hires rarely receive training from competent individuals and may go their entire time not knowing basic things because management is useless.
- The customers you have to deal with tend to have the intelligence of a rock and the arrogance of fools; the most infuriating and neurotic of people.
- At our location, the store is never cleaned by any janitorial crew. It is filthy and disgusting.
- Managers sit around in their little office all day doing nothing like the useless parasites they are.
- Store keeps on hiring way beyond capacity; our location has over 70 people hired and we have dedicated workers only working eight hours a week. Are you kidding me?

[pros: You get a Christmas bonus and a couple free lunches per month (assuming you hit sales goals).  That's about it.  This place is honestly 99.9% bad.
cons: Where to begin?  Read the reviews. They are all 5 stars or 1 star.  Does that seem odd?  The reason is because the CEO (Jim Dettore) is a crazy egomaniac and he needs the positive reviews to stroke his ego.  He forces employees to write these obviously fake reviews.  Here's the real story:

Jim Dettore himself interviews you. He sells you on the job that seems too good to be true.  But when you show up on your first day, the nightmare begins.  He hires scientists and pharmacists just to use their titles to impress pharma execs then expects them to magically be salesmen. No sales training, no support. He just gives you an unrealistic sales goal and if you don't meet it, you get belittled and screamed at.  This is not an exaggeration either.  I saved several screenshots of emails and recordings of voicemails as proof.

Jim fires people routinely and brags about it during morning meetings as if it's a badge of honor.

You are expected to check your email regularly on nights, weekends, and holidays and are expected to never go anywhere without your company phone on you (even on vacation).  During my tenure, I took a vacation one time (only 3 work days) and was contacted numerous times by management that I needed to work during my trip.  Upon my return, I was chastised by Jim Dettore as lazy because vacations are for lazy people and he hates lazy people.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, too.
It was an absolutely unreal place to work.  I would not recommend working at Brand Institute to my worst enemy.

Many of the fake reviews (any of the positive ones are fake) try to claim the people that rightfully criticize BI are just lazy and couldn't hack it.  Sorry.  That's an absolute falsehood.  The people saying that are either Jim's lap dogs or they are jealous that people got out of this nightmare company and found much better jobs elsewhere.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: They had a very flexible schedule while I was a student. They also paid better than any student job that was on-campus. When I started doing the job full-time, it was still a joy to do. You get paid holiday and vacation time, every sunday and federal holiday off, etc. It is a great place to start to gain valuable customer service skills and cash-handling experience.
cons: The only 'con' I can think about is that you have to be super vigilant about fraud, and it can at times make you a bit paranoid. You wouldn't believe how many people try to cash fake checks, hand in fake money, or try to pose as someone else. You get better at identifying fake items with more time on the job.] =",excellent,excellent,bad

[pros: Ledcor is a company that is very diverse in the services it offers, and contains many different divisions (e.g. Construction, Pipeline, Highway Maintenance, etc.) Because of this, learning reception was challenging in a positive way -- meaning there is a lot to learn, but it is an interesting and dynamic company with lots to offer.
cons: The downside to being a receptionist at Ledcor is what I imagine to be the downside of being a receptionist anywhere -- after you've learned the job and have familiarized yourself with the daily tasks, it because rather mundane and repetitive. This is not so much a negative reflection of the company, but possibly just the nature of the position.] =",neutral,good,excellent

[pros: Interesting work and the opportunity to be at the center of the action during the pandemic. Some people are really nice. There are a lot of long-term employees.
cons: The pandemic has really brought to light how this company and its senior management are spineless. They push uneccessary tests, claim that COVID-19 tests will keep you safe for travel, etc. etc. The worst thing is the lack of a vaccine mandate. This is a healthcare company that doesn't believe in science. They won't require people to get vaccinated. Even McDonalds requires people to get vaccinated. They do not care about the heros that have given their all during this trying time. There is a way to stop the spread, its called a vaccine. They think there are ""good people on both sides"" of the vaccine debate. False.] =",good,terrible,bad

[pros: -Pay is high, but once you factor in the mandatory unpaid overtime it's not as great as it was.
-Very generous holiday schedule: almost 3 weeks per year.
cons: -Mandatory unpaid overtime, with the threat of being laid off if you don't do enough.
-The company Only hires new grads, while laying off older workers to limit pension and medical expenses.  The brain drain is huge and the company is losing core competencies all the time in the name of saving money.
-Management retaliates for using sick time.  You'll lose promotions over it.  The result is that people are afraid to be out and come to work sick, infecting everyone else.
-The company regularly tows cars from the employee lot, then afterwards calls them to let them know.  Why not call them in the first place so they could fix the problem BEFORE towing and costing them $250 to get their cars back?
-A small number of older workers who are coasting towards retirement are allowed to perform badly and stay.  There's no accountability.
-Managers copy trendy Silicon Valley habits without understanding why they work elsewhere, and why they don't work at Bell.
-The company likes to talk about being ""Employer of Choice"" and a ""Quality of Life Company"" up until the financials start looking weak.  Then, all that talk disappears until now we're being told to empty our own trashcans because the janitors have been cut back so much.
-The company pays lip service to innovation and collaboration, but doesn't trust its workforce enough to unleash them to do those things.  Bell is far too risk averse.
-The whole performance review process is broken and incapable of identifying and rewarding your accomplishments.  On top of that, management games it heavily to suppress raises.  No matter how much you do, how much your direct managers praise you, you're still not getting better than 3% per year raises.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

The later you stay at the office, the better you look to upper management. There is no effort to foster a collaborative studio culture, and upper management obviously does not care about their employees. You can quit after a decade of invaluable service, and they will simply show you out the door and hire someone else. Hiring is haphazard and desperate, staffing is inconsiderate and unbalanced. Management does not know how to handle 100+ employees, and they're not trying to change their outdated ways of running things or listening to complaints.

[pros: - If you know how to download and open Visual Studio, they will take you in as an intern at the very least

- If you end up in the right team, you will have a good time and actually learn a lot. And most of the Trainers and OG's are super cool people

- Depending on the team that you're on, you can end up learning useful transferable skills that can be utilized in the industry or your day to day life, or you can learn the Sandhills skills where it is not transferable and after 2-3 years of experience still won't actually know how to setup an API endpoint

- You will have tons of free time to troll your coworkers or watch youtube videos because as long as you log your 8 hours, they won't question your actual output or contribution to the sprint/company

- Free meat every year i guess
cons: - If you don't log 8 hours you will get yelled at. Even though it's physically impossible to be working 8 hours straight. An average person puts in 5-6 hours of actual productive work out of 8 hours. So if you force people to log 8 hours, your data will never be as accurate as it should be. Unless there is a bathroom or socializing task, then I take it all back

- Mass hire unqualified employees/intern. It's amazing how many interns they hire over a short amount of time that are not qualified for the job. They end up slowing everyone down and wasting company time

- If your shirt gets slightly untucked or if your tie is crooked while working, your code will not compile until you fix yourself. (at least that's what they make it seem like)

- Don't work too hard because no one else around you is. Why work your butt off for 6-7 hours when most everyone else is working 3-4 hours and goofing off for the other 3 for the same pay? You decide your work/life balance.. during work

- No work/life balance. If you car gets snowed in or breaks down and you've used up all your vacation days, they will make you take unpaid or you best uber to work boi. Even though everyone on your team is remote and they won't even know the difference either way

- Some C levels will threaten and belittle you for certain goofs, no matter how long you've been in the company. I'm all about having my mistakes pointed out so I can improve, but don't just roast people. Roast them and then tell them how they can improve] =",bad,terrible,excellent

- Harsh working environment with high turnover at manager level, which means little proper guidance is provided as managers are busy playing politics & managing up/down

[pros: 1. You are thrown into complex projects that you have no prior ideas about.  You get baptized by fire (supported by good colleagues) and get to learn a lot of new things (Skill wise, Domain wise and Technology wise)

2. Mangers are very supportive (except a very few).  They will help you get your problems sorted out 

3.  If you are a Business Analyst, you get good client exposure

4.  Many people whom you work with are excellent and are nice.  In fact, i still maintain good relationships with people in the org even though I left the organization

5.  Peer to Peer recognition is a good system

6. The work you perform will always be two levels above what you are expected to do.  For example, a senior associate (C2) would be put into a situation that would require them to function as a Consultant (C4) 

7. Some of the learning courses are good, but it is not open to all.  

8.  People who have small kids, can make use of the facilities available within the campus

9. Leadership team is very warm and approachable.  I have personally interacted with the then CEO KK and the current CEO Rostov and found them to be welcoming

10.  The processes within the company for various operations are very well defined and can be easily accessed.  This makes the life of employees a lot simpler

11. Flexible timings (Entry timings, still have to maintain 9.5 hrs)  and Work from Home policies
cons: 1. Pay is particularly bad.  Standard HR reasons for not being able to match your salary to market standards are given 

2.  There is always a power struggle between Managers and Middle level managers.  IF you are unfortunate, you will get caught between the politics 

3.  Increments are given only on the threat of leaving.  If you are performing well, standard small increments apply.  But put down your papers, suddenly their purses open to retain.  Why not offer better in the first place to retain? 

4.  Insurance is part of the CTC.  Shouldn't it be over and above the CTC if you really care about your employees 

5. The Exit interview I had was horrible.  HR didn’t have the courtesy to call for a fact to face.  If the intent to not retain is clear, do inform the employee of the same and specify the reasons.  I got the counter offer on the penultimate day with a question from the HR ""Are you excited about the offer"".  It was way below the offer which I held and specifically mentioned that I wouldn't budge below a certain limit

6. Some of the policies are plain hypocritical.  If an employee doesn’t spend the average of 9.5*5 hours a week, a report is sent to the manager.  But no worries, most performers are overtaxed and will always clock more.  Some even take their work home, but that doesn’t count, does it?

7.  If you really care about your employee’s career path, let them do Internationally recognized certifications and support it.  For example:  a CCBA or a CBAP is recognized by all organizations.  You should let your BAs do that instead of the MCBA which is an internal Mindtree certification.  You might have argued that it is as competitive as a CBAP.  But at the end of the day, no one is going to recognize me as a MCBA outside Mindtree. Instead I would be rather proud to say that my company sponsored for my CBAP degree and instill my confidence in the company

8. Location is Isolated.  If for any reason you stay late, chances are that you will not get any public transportation out. Ubers and Ola, LOL not happening.  And the strangest part, you have to raise a cab request 2-3 hour prior your leaving time.  You might say it helps us in planning for cabs, but let's be realistic.  I stay back, and I do not know when work might get over.  I stretch if required to get the deliverables done.  So please tell us, how can an employee calculate the time at which they might leave the office?

9.  Panty Operations - Hats off, limited time working? I mean seriously, your cost cutting comes in by locking the pantry.  It is not going to cost you much to at least keep hot water and few teabags if not the coffee machine and milk.  We just need a hot drink to help our brains relax 

10.  This one pains me the most.  People are recognized as Outstanding performers, consistently outstanding performers, peer, manager and client nominated performers.  You recognize them, good.  But when it comes to increments, you are still found wanting.  So, no way are you going to get some good increments.  In fact, no matter how much you outperform, financially you are still going to find yourself earning far lower (in case you are a campus recruit).  One of the reason was -  You are from a Tier 2 B-School, so this is your slab.  So, my question is should I tone down my performance and perform according to a Tier 2 graduate?  When appraisals are done, you are compared against your peers who are from Tier 1 B Schools too.  Despite being recognized by Clients, peers and managers as outstanding performers, the parity is still wide and every year you stay back it gets wider.

11.  People who work hard and perform are rewarded with even more work, up until the point of frustration that many of the performers leave the company.  But hey the general attitude is, I can hire 4 to do what you were doing.  So, go ahead. 

12.  This is common to the IT industry I guess.  The Lure of Onsite Opportunities -The way to retain people is by offering an upcoming onsite opportunity.  If the employee falls in the trap, there are very low chances that they might get it.  This works on 90% of the employees who are loyal to a fault and believe in the words.  But if it is not given in written communication, don’t take it.  Seriously guys you must stop this practice. Truth is far better than false promises.  It is close to deception.  I wonder how this doesn’t fall under the concepts of Integrity?  People are asked to take the course every year, but I guess it is a very subjective topic. 

13.  By God if you are moved to different project with a different manager, you can consider your appraisals screwed.  IT is going to be a struggle to get your right rating out

14.  Online course aggregator like Udemy/Coursera was not available when i was working there.  It allows people to explore skills and learn new things that might not be directly related to their work.  This allows people to learn and grow inorganically.

15.  Some managers just like to micromanage and make your life miserable.  But this is not really the company's fault in one aspect.  But it should try take surveys and then make sure such people attend necessary trainings to reduce the micromanagement behavior 

16.  Provide proper sports facilities and gyms.  Please do not call than run down place of equipment’s a gym. The probability of getting unhealthy is greater than getting healthy] =",neutral,bad,excellent

[pros: 1. You can work remotely for the technology team
2. Team lunches were fun
3. There are several nice people here
cons: My observations are from my experience in the tech team:

1. Toxic culture, especially the heads
2. Lack of leadership
3. Lack of transparency between senior, mid and junior
4. Unstable and chaotic: A lot of people quit soon after joining (like me)
5. There are two-faced people in the tech team
6. It is common for the line manager to look through previous comms (Teams and emails) after you leave the company.

Please note that not everyone in the team is like that and I hope they fix these problems for the employees that decide to stay. 

I advise you to delete all your comms before leaving the company. An employee left the company, and their comms were reviewed and mocked in front of me.] =",neutral,terrible,bad

[pros: They provide great employee benefits as far as discounts and they do provide health, dental and vision insurance and 401K match. They offer reimbursement and schooling options as well. You will do very well in this company if you know a lot of people who already work there or if you like to be a brown noser- Not for your talent though unless you like to work more than 50 hours a week while others take credit for the work.
cons: The benefits are out of this world expensive and the coverage is not the greatest. The managers and hire ups care about one thing that most companies care about which is money. The employees themselves do not matter. Its always ways to save money and give the higher ups more money while the employees that are taking calls or managing the employees continue to get the bare minimum

My almost 10 year career ended when I chose to leave mostly because of my manager had no interest for the last two years in helping me develop or help my agents develop. It was all about numbers and I was always given work that took more than a normal 40 hour work week. That was while working remote. A normal week was 50-60 hours because they didnt want to hire extra help. Then when raises and bonuses come, my manager would benefit while we as a team were left behind. 

I couldnt take the mental stress this job took on my life. They allowed us to work remotely pre covid as we needed to. Then during covid we would work at home and then post covid they pulled us all back in office right when the gas prices sky rocketed due to inflation. My drive was 45 minutes and I found it highly unreasonable that they wouldnt allow any flexibility post covid. 

I wanted to retire from this company and after 9 years my ex-boss shook my hand and said it was a pleasure meeting me. Nothing more. The lack of recognition and support along with resources needed was the main reasons I decided to find another company to work for. I now work for a wonderful company with a boss that is amazing and communicates and gets any help needed for my team. Proceed with caution when working here.] =",bad,terrible,terrible

2. The crowd - all the talented people you work & interact with
3. Compensation & benefits are competitive with the market
4. Open door culture - you can literally reach out to anyone at any level and express your opinion
cons: 1. Although the performance management system @ Microsoft is relatively better than some of the similar ranked companies in India; it can get very manipulative & diluted at the ground level. At the end of the day your manager would be trying to fit you within a curve. Also, even if you have done a great job through out the year that does not guarantee you a very good review as your performance is compared against your peers; in spite of the fact that not everyone might have done the same level/complexity/type of work as you did; which is kind of absurd.

2. The quality of work which comes to this (primarily) offshore based team has been detoriating over time. Although you might end up getting a Consultant title, most of the time you would end up working on repetitive type tasks (which are generally done by any other SI's with a larger team). Very less and rare customer facing opportunities.

3. Very very slow career growth rate within the organization. It used to be much better when the Org size used was smaller (in terms of people). 

4. At times you are required to sign-up for some really unrealistic commitments, which you may not be able to meet or will just meet them for the sake of it (compromising the quality).] =",good,neutral,good

[pros: It sounds cool when you tell people you work there. Free parking. Benefits are pretty standard. They give you Kroger gift cards on thanksgiving and Christmas.
cons: There is little to zero training involved, any information given to you by management will usually just set you up for failure. 
Management doesn't know how to do any of the jobs of the people they manage, but are quick to offer worthless advice. 
The work culture is pretty terrible. There are no raises in pay for going above and beyond, the only reward you receive for hard work and aptitude is more work load. 
The attendance policy is pretty extreme with no flexibility or common sense. 
Make no mistakes, management or HR do not care about the work force. They will do everything possible to push their shortcomings on to you, then write you up for it.

[pros: The company retains a large number of high-profile clients. Though I saw the talent level decline during my tenure, Edelman still attracts many bright people. It still looks good on a resume, and you make useful connections while working there.  PTO and benefits were quite good.
cons: You work long hours for low pay.  I've seen the demanding hours cause high levels of stress and, at times, ruin people's personal lives. 

The company may be a leader in PR, but the overall sophistication is not in the same ballpark as marketing firms and in-house marketing departments. If the firm wants to play in the world of marketing, they need to step up their game. The firm seems to have a false sense of how sophisticated their work is. Social listening, press releases, and tweets are essentially commodity offerings nowadays.] =",bad,bad,bad

[pros: Ten percent discount on goods you probably do not even want anyway.
cons: Working here was one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made. Nothing that you do is ever good enough, promotions are all but impossible, and the products are not even slightly compelling. Unless you want a job that's easy and surrounded by products for people who can't cook from scratch, stay far away from this company. If you went to college and expect to use your education towards tackling complex problems, writing reports, making presentations, and doing anything requiring more than a junior high level education, this is not the place for you. The lack of challenge makes this job stressful, and the general public will never take you as an equal because you won't be compensated fairly, most of your coworkers are morons, and you wear a t-shirt and plastic name tag to work.] =",neutral,terrible,bad

cons: The management honestly needs help, while you work here you work for 2 masters one being convergys and the other being the client and sometimes the two conflict and people get fired.

[pros: Fast paced environment where you can gain many new skills. I would Only recommend that you accept a position here if you seek new skills and are not picky about the company overall. There can be opportunities to move around which is a pro. You will have to hit the ground running. You will likely not receive much training. The company is often described as ""sink or swim."" Stock bonus $ is nice but you have to be there for 15 months before you start seeing any of the $. Bonus will likely be less than is presented in the offer.
cons: It is a negative culture. I was at the company full-time for 2 years. Overall it is not a culture where employees feel valued or supported by management of any level or co-workers. There were Many dissatisfied employees when I was there. Benefits are limited and pay and bonus are below average. You are not rewarded when you should be, for example when you switch teams and take on a new role (even if it is a lateral move) in my opinion you should be rewarded.

[pros: Salary is paid on time.
cons: * Useless middle management who do nothing and contribute (seemingly) nothing to the company in any useful capacity. 

* No co-ordination for covering the work of people who are sick or on holidays.

* Absolutely terrible IT equipment for the job, we are waiting for new laptops for 1+ years now!! A NUC is not suitable for the job!!!

* Often far too much work for one person to handle in a normal day so overtime IS REQUIRED (But not paid). This is entirely exacerbated by the horrible state of the IT equipment which often will hang and become unresponsive.

* Hiring practices are a shamble, training is non-existent, you are thrown into the job and have to trial by fire. Good luck new hires. 

* Lack of coherent internal knowledge base, so finding answers for problems is not possible for motivated people who like to work autonomously. 

* Internal DHL staff from other city locations can often be brash, rude, confrontational and downright unprofessional at times, which highlights a broader systemic issue within DHL.

[pros: -place to grow professionally as a beginner if you get a good team with experienced colleagues and you show will to learn 
-good hours (depends on the project)
cons: -Salary rarely gets a raise, but you will be aware of it from your colleagues around you as you notice their discomfort if you mention your salary as a newcomer( I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wishes to be coached there)
-Not all teams are equal (there are different second layer teams for example)
-Management does count on you leaving weather you like it or not due to automation and business from customers has to cost less every year
-Automation teams are basically non-existent
-usual corporate hassle which is good if you are a beginner but if you are not you may experience some discomfort

[pros: *If you are down on your luck, whether it be a useless degree, a lack of proper trade education, a severe lack of good paying jobs in your area, or perhaps you are old and laid off, a grocery store cashier clerk job is the way to go!

*Especially Fry's, because they will offer you an associate rewards card that will give a 10 percent discount off of select items that you buy from the store.  Even better, each purchased item gives you 1 fuel point per every $1 spent, and every 100 fuel points equals to about a 10 cent discount on Fry's affiliated gas stations.  To keep it short, working and shopping at Fry's can save you a lot of money.

*Plenty other departments to work at, like bakery, deli, and floral, and some could even impart real life skills to you.  I worked at the a bakery for a given

* 10 minute breaks for 4-7 hour shifts.  15 minute breaks for 8 hours and beyond.

*Friendly and helpful management is there to get you out of stumping situations.

*The staff is friendly and can feel like family in a way.

*Competitive hours, the better you do, the more you will be needed.

*Union friendly

*You can earn stickers on a sheet that rally up to a total in a raffle for exceptional performance, you can possibly win a car with this.
cons: * Self Check-out shifts can be a little on the boring side.

*A lot of standing in one place, but that's expected.

*As said, if you plan to buy a house, or start a family or fund a business, the finances from this job will not cover something like that unless perhaps if you are extremely stingy with money.

*This might just be from my perspective, but at first, the management that is in charge of your work hours will not assign a consistent schedule.  Instead hours may be randomized depending on the amount of available free time that you give  them.  You will not be able to pick your hours regularly, though sometimes each month, they will give you a binder, where you can pick certain hours that are available.] =",good,good,excellent

[pros: Pay is somewhat competitive for new employees - higher than most of the older employees.  The benefits are also great - $.25 Soda, gym, 401K and matching, Employee Discounted Stock, Med/Dental/Vision, and a game room - almost all available from day 1. PayPal is the king of online payments, so you also have a lot of job security as long as you stay on the good side you supervisor (even if you NEVER hit metrics!).
cons: PayPal tries to put up a facade of a company that lets successful people thrive and innovate. This may be true for the non-call center position, but it's definitely fool's gold at the call centers. It's all about who you know rather than how well you do your job. If you're well liked by management, they will essentially get you the schedule and position that you're looking for. If you fall into disfavor, look forward to skipped one-on-one meetings (required weekly coaching meetings that help YOU improve with your manager), low yearly ratings, strict enforcement and harassment, no promotion and/or moving out of the department, write ups, and possibly even termination. I have seen people get fired for absolutely BS reasons. There are rare opportunities to move up, but most people try to move sideways off the phones, which gets you stuck there for 6+ months. 

There is also a culture of misinformation and deception both to employees and customers. Managers regularly withhold information or straight up lie. For a company that supposedly focuses on being transparent with customers and employees, they fall short. A fun lie is that ""PayPal has never been hacked."" While it is true that there has not been an attack that has successfully taken large amounts of data (as far as PayPal knows), ALL systems are hackable - it's a matter of how fast you detect, catch, and expel the invader. We also had to regularly lie about ""system undergoing maintenance"" when something would crash or a bug was plaguing the system. While technically true in the sense that engineers/techs would be updating the system to fix these, it implies that the bugs/outages are intentional - which is definitely intentional deception.

Also in the 3 years that I worked here, I was always one of the top performers and even received the top rating for each yearly review (Exceeds Most), yet cumulatively I received only 7.5% raises. One of those raises was from getting a slight promotion, that they ended up giving to ALL customer service agents less than 6 months later.] =",good,terrible,bad

[pros: The atmosphere in GoodLife fitness is really great, the people who work at the gym are friendly and informative as well. I started this job trying to lose weight and I'm down over 50 pounds. The free gym membership is awesome and there's never a reason to not go to the gym because you work there.
cons: For the FA role it can be long hours trying to gather leads, and when you work at a GoodLife not in a major city getting leads is like pulling teeth. You might spend 4 hours doing lead generation and walk away empty handed.  Inadvertently you find yourself staying for unpaid overtime to try and reach your sales/leads/appointments goals so management stays out of your hair.

Besides that the job is very taxing, you need a thick skin because cold calls sometimes end in cussing and threats (not kidding). Then there's the emphasis on selling personal training which most people just don't want but GoodLife has a PT quota as well which adds even more pressure. Making your sales, great, not hitting 30% PT, there's still a problem. 

Some people are great at this job, kudos to them. It's really hard outside of urban areas and in my opinion not worth the stress.] =",bad,terrible,excellent

You’re not allowed to work remotely and there’s no flexibility in hours. They say that your career is “go at your own pace” but that is not true as they will hold you back from promotions.

[pros: Good work/family life balance; nice flexibility. Safety and communications is very strong within the culture.  Great gym and cafeteria at Waltham building.
cons: Management employees (as opposed to union personnel) seem to know their job well, but don't appear to be subject matter experts in their field.  Metrics don't exist by which true employee competence is gauged or tracked.  Employees are rarely pushed to think creatively to accomplish innovation.  If you really know what you're doing, you may become disappointed that the bar is set so low, and that everyone seems fine with that.  Competency and skill set development is discouraged.  Personally, I was ridiculed within my own team for having earned a global certification, which was disappointing. Compensation is based upon a popularity contest with those team members whom socialize/golf/drink with key players after work.  Workforce is a bit timid, because 1,200 employees were fired a couple years ago and replaced with contractors.  Accomplishing the simplest of tasks requires outsourced calls to other states/countries.  Leaving as soon as a land a similar position elsewhere.] =",excellent,excellent,bad

[pros: Pre-2000 when Sir John Templeton was still alive, employees were treated like human beings. Work life was well balanced and positive. People leaders actually earned their positions and paved the way to a prosperous future.
cons: Now, those that have paved the way have either retired or told to leave by being granted roles that would discourage them to stay on. End result- when the mass lay offs occurred, supervisors that got the position because of connections are left crying- exposed for not knowing their role, even having been in the company for over 15 years. There's a great handful of these arrogant rude leaders that only act tough as a false facade- terrorizing those that know the business, discouraging them to even think of advancing in their current position. Sabotaging their performance appraisals, and making the most loyal of all staff feel lower than dirt. When Sir John passed away, a lot of the humanity and spirit died with him. So too have the loyal customers passed on. These leaders think it's some kind of farce. Instead of solving problems and leading, they make mischief and tomfoolery on their staff, lowering their self esteem and quality of work. Firing left and right just to cover and sweep things under the carpet. Now the company is a circus, shuffling current staff to cover work of a different department. Retention of knowledge is lower therefore more mistakes and fund losses. Vacations can't even be planned- we have a skeleton crew!  The specialists are only assuming on conjecture- not knowing the departments from which they are writing procedures and policies for. The total focus is lost. And when someone does something spectacular to save the company all they are given is a $5 Tim Horton's card. While staff from the US are given a plane ticket ,accommodations and acknowledged for their contributions and loyalty with a spectacular celebration. Shame!] =",bad,terrible,terrible

[pros: Decent pay, good benefits and work schedule allows for a good work/home balance.
cons: There is no help for leadership.  Management is not given support from their upper management. There is not a clear job description for the positions. They are not properly trained or given the proper resources to excel at their job. They are left short staffed for long periods of time and this is causing a drop in training. Management cannot focus on new employees, implement proper training programs or focus on safety/productivity concerns because they are often filling in positions on the floor that do not have a hired employee to fill them. HR pressures management to hire employees just because they are a warm body and even if you turn down a bad interview HR will hire them anyway. We were unable to reward the good employees and provide incentive for them to stay, when you ask to give employees a promotion or boost in pay it normally is not given approval, they do this by never getting back to you. If you try to coach employees who are refusing to perform job tasks, you are often told you cannot. Ex. Employee will not stay at work station, you talk to them about the importance of staying at their work station. HR says you are picking on the employee and you are no longer allowed to coach them. They are burning out their staff, all the way from their production management to the floor employees. They have a large group of fantastic production operators and hand packers, it's a shame that we could not reward them for their efforts. They push through long days of being short staffed just to come back and do it again.] =",good,good,bad

[pros: -culture
-meaningful work 
-very valuable experience in the long run
-sets you up for outstanding career (as long as you take what you learn and leave.)

My local office had a strong culture of team work and autonomous decision making at the recruitment level which made for a great sense of pride and individual and group accomplishments. My manager was a strong leader and he was a great mentor that I trust and respect. I enjoyed my team and the program's I managed.
cons: -corporate bureaucracy 
-overwhelming pressure to produce sales in high volume over high quality. 
-lowest salary for a recruiter out there - hands down

At Maxim, you're working in a niche market. The only staff we hired are nurses and CNAs. Nurses are truly ungrateful and know that you need them more than they need you. Maxim has tough Margins because so much of their office revenue goes to corporate while recruiters make 15k less per year than they should be and nurses are paid 20-40% less than they would in a comparative at any other agency. The nurses are tough but Maxim gives them NOTHING. No PTO, no guaranteed work, very unaffordable high deductible health plans they can't afford and they lose it if their client is sick or in the hospital and they miss work. Recruiters makes 36k with a tiny commission plan. Usually 100 buck a week. Recruiters do not have a coordinator or scheduler. They act as recruiters, HR managers, care coordinators, schedulers, and operation managers while earning the salary of receptionist. It's truly a shame. 

It's the perfect entry-level job because you learn more than you ever would have dreamed but take what you learn and get out in favor of more rewarding opportunities. Also, many recruiters want to grow into HR management. Maxim only wants You to become Business Development Managers which is a fancy title for business to business direct sales. The attitude at Maxim is greed and act like commission-only vacuum cleaner salesman when they should be focused on quality care delivery to the patients they serve. They will take nurses from a difficult case to work on a higher revenue case and leave the other client without care and then let them fall off their roster. I've seen it happen many times.] =",terrible,bad,excellent

[pros: I was with the company for about 10 years, got hired in right after the strike in 05. Depending on what department you are working in or what property, there are good things such as bonuses for hourly a few for salary and PTO time, and some really good people to work with. It was fun while it lasted.
cons: Not enough salary bonuses, the hourly benefit more than salary, I was on both ends of the workforce, only got 2 salary bonuses. The company does not have their stuff together, and if they every do, it will be a good company to work for. However,  they will need to clean house with some of the management, and bring in people that do know how to run a property and treat their work force with respect. If you put a bad taste in ASARCO's mouth they find a reason to get rid of you! I would come back to work only as a last resort or until the company settles on a contract or cleans house all across the board! It was a experience I will never forget.

[pros: Casual dress code including jeans
cons: It's pretty sad when the only reason you don't mind going to work is because your can wear jeans, and then every other aspect of the job makes you physically ill.  I wish I could've reviewed this company at zero stars. A one star review is being generous.

This is the worst job I've ever had - a typical day would consist of lying to potential customers about how quickly their project would be completed, helping the executives dodge phone calls from angry existing customers, searching the office for the executives to get something completed (only to find out they had gone off-site to smoke cigars for hours) - all while enduring abusive texts from said executives telling me that I'm not doing enough and am not needed, I am lying, I do things wrong, etc.

I have never felt so belittled and useless in my life. Accepting this job has really done a number on my self esteem - I've never doubted myself and my professional talents more. You will be taught to do something one way, only to get yelled at later on for doing it that way. There are never any set standard operational procedures - they will change it on you and blame you for doing it ""wrong"" even when you are doing it exactly as you were initially taught.

Terribly depressing and toxic culture. Not a single person actually likes their job or the executives. There are video cameras around the office and outside - so no one feels comfortable or trusted. I personally felt very uneasy and violated knowing that everything and everyone was constantly being monitored. No one feels appreciated or valued. Everyone is expected to work like robots - nonstop and without making any mistakes.

I was let go on a Friday morning over the phone (without being given an actual reason ) and told to have a 'nice life'.  The President/CEO only cares about himself and the company. Not employees- and especially not his employees' personal lives. Time off is not allowed and anytime there is medical need that needs addressed, he will not only make you feel guilty about needing some personal time but will also accuse you of lying and then force you to make up the time- even as a salaried employee!

[pros: I worked here for 8 years in Software Development using C++. Bangalore Office. I Started my career here. Great company for taking leaves and being constant touch with family. Global vision is great. This is more like real world scenario where nobody ask you to do anything, but you are free to do anything and you can find an audience to show-case. One Can get more involved with business and suggest optimizations by prototypes. Nowadays more focused Patents and IP. Long projects and relaxed release cycles. Best company to settle if you enter with a decent salary.
cons: No Organizational push to sharpen IT knowledge. India division is lagging behind global counter parts - in performance and taking up responsibilities. Messy Management system. For Growth, Your luck is more important than individual skills. top 1 or 2 employees in a team are given high focus and attrition of rest of the team is considered okay.

[pros: The only good thing in the company where the diversity of the team members and trust me, there are some really great people doing the ""low, blue collar"" work.
cons: Overworked - Mainly happen because of the big number of people leaving and not being replaced, so all the work is pilled on top of the remaining workers.

Projects were not resourced well - At one point I was covering 3 roles and of course being paid for one :))))

Poor communication from management - Especially when COVID struck...fiasco

Very bad processes - but this happens in many other companies. Yet you still need management to enforce people to apply the process...that didn't happen.

Old fashioned approach to management - Clearly visible that the company is still ""Connaught Electronics"" with a Valeo suit on top.....no wonder auditors think that the production lines are old and unreliable.

Constant crisis mode - Because of the above mentioned point where the projects are not staffed properly. All the quotes for new projects are made in a manner for Valeo to ""win"" the project, with unrealistic project resource planning.

No staff development - Even when you do ""get promoted"", all you get are promises and responsibilities, no actual pay increase or even in some cases no ""updates on the company papers"" in regards to your new role....

Long Hours Expected - Yes, they are expected of you, but get this...you have a contract of 39 weekly hours, but only after you worked 42 hours, anything above is considered extra and you lose the extra hours in 2 months. Also they are not paid.

Unprofessional HR department - How about you offer feedback to all the candidates in due time, regardless of what the feedback is. I know people that had interviews(with department managers), got promised feedback in 10 days and at this moment 2 months have passed with no feedback at all....what is that about HR ?? And you call yourself the image of the company....very unprofessional 

And many more, but this should give you an idea.] =",neutral,terrible,good

[pros: Working with some really great people and really great clients. I derive a lot of job satisfaction doing everything I can for our best clients, some of whom are just a pleasure to work with. Aon has some seriously talented insurance specialists in their respective fields (environmental, management liabilities, claims, etc.) My work is also mostly challenging, varied, and interesting. Decent work life balance, too. Compensation is also decent and not terribly out of line with the other big brokers. My immediate boss is also outstanding and I've learned much from him over the years. I'm lucky in that I have a very short commute.
cons: As one client said, ""Aon can put together a $1 billion plus insurance program, but can't get an invoice out."" Offshoring and outsourcing back office functions hurts the company in the long run.

Absolutely horrible bureaucracy, especially with respect to IT. For example, I needed to update Java to access a prospects data room. At home, the process took less than 2 minutes. At work, after six weeks of trying, multiple layers of approvals and calls to India, I gave up. Contrary to ""Client Promise"", Aon will also sometimes put its internal bureaucracy ahead of a client's reasonable wishes.

Free complimentary nights 
Free meals

cons: Low pay for the mid-level managers. For example, guest services manager are making around 60k while working 12-14 hours a day and stay on call on their weekends.So forget about your family holidays and weekends.
Free complimentary nights are rarely available/ or available during off season. You are more than welcome to visit Miami during hurricane season or Damascus in Syria during the war.
No appreciation for extra efforts.
No empowerment or trust from the upper management for the line staff. The managers always think that they know better and get on the way of the experienced associates.
Free meals are decent during mon- fri....However; they are  horrible during the weekends (why care if most of the managers are not there).
The management always emphasizes its superiority. Usually they have 10-15 manager's outing at the company's expense during a year while the line staff employees have only one.] =",terrible,terrible,good

[pros: Plenty of opportunities to try new things without having to switch companies or relocate
cons: Not many perks and benefits that most people would use.  General benefits (retirement contributions, bonuses, stock options, etc...) have been on the decline the last decade.  ""Competitive with peer companies"" is the excuse although they used to be much better and justified lower base salaries because of those higher benefits.  Now the benefits are lower but the salaries remain the same.
Small working environment.  Never had offices.  Started off with gray 72 sq ft cubicles.  Then they ""compressed"" the cubicles to 48 sq ft.  Then they replaced the 6'-tall gray cubicle walls with 5'-tall tan walls to ""facilitate collaboration"".  This just made things noisier.  They also shrunk the furniture to make your 48 sq ft veal pen feel roomy.  Now they are compressing these smaller cubes into 36 sq ft.  It feels like some sick and twisted version of Moore's Law applied to office space density.
Company used to emphasis the culture and our six core values.  Not so much anymore.  I think that was an Andy Grove thing.  Last few CEO's appear to have been made from a different mold (although the same mold) -- less emphasis on the employees that made the company great and more emphasis on responding reactively to the bottom line.] =",good,neutral,bad

[pros: There are lots of very interesting and challenging problems to work on.  The work is very rewarding and fulfilling.  I've worked in 3 different business areas so there's quite a bit of opportunity to move around if that's what you want.  There are locations all over the US.  I have always been impressed with the extremely intelligent and talented people I've worked with during the 15 years I've worked there.
cons: It's a very, very big company and there is substantial management overhead.  There isn't a real strong technical career path for mid-level engineers or beyond.  The benefits keep getting worse.] =",good,good,excellent

[pros: -amazing coworkers, people aren't there for the money, they want to better the lives of others
-great supervisors
-get to work in the community, every day is different, gain familiarity with the city
-never boring- you'll remember this stuff for the rest of your life
-lots of laughs (okay this is to cope with the emotional stress, but still)
-some clients are really rewarding to work with, you develop meaningful relationships with them and staff
-opportunity for self growth/personal development
cons: -exposure to dangerous situations. in the few years I was there, members of my team were sexually assaulted, physically assaulted, robbed, sued, threatened, you name it. sadly the agency does support or protect the staff from this. one director told me he wouldn't let his daughter work there, which speaks to the lack of safety in the workplace.
-I never heard of people getting raises and the pay is in the social worker range (side note- ACT does get paid more than regular case management, which is fair because they have the most intense clients)
-almost always work over 40 hours
-you need to have a car and you're on the road a lot. if you stay for more than a year and drive around a few hours a day, including to unsafe neighborhoods, the chances of getting in an accident or getting your car broken into are pretty high. those costs come out of your own pocket. also clients view you as a taxi and demand you drive them places.. most people agree to do this and bill it as building a therapeutic relationship but it's really just enabling them to be dependent on the agency

[pros: The people are very outgoing and its a really chill place to work at. Folding isnt that hard, you get the hang of everything pretty quickly. It's good to have as a first job since they hire at 17. It's kind of like a ""little job on the side for extra cash"" job
cons: You might think the discounts cool but its not; you get 20% off everything UNLESS its already marked down more than that then there are the AAA's in which you get 50% for two weeks when the floor changes but its not often at all. You get called a ""model"" not a sales associate so a lot of employees get stuck up because of that and its really annoying. You can't be full-time unless you are a manager. There isnt really any benefits at all besides the kind of ok discounts. You don't get many hours since they hire SOOOOO many people and they also have call-ins which is honestly all i get taking into consideration that ive been working here for 2 years its really bad and almost most of the time never use you. They don't really train you at all. you have to learn how to fold by yourself now since they got rid of the folding boards. you pretty much have to learn everything by yourself even though its pretty easy but still. my only advice is ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS.] =",good,neutral,bad

-management likes to choose favourites
-fear mongering by management in the face of the union drive. 
-you're treated like the lowest of the low, while pilots get whatever they want - even though we work the same schedules (and flight attendants actually work more days than the pilots). 
-They can extend your day and you HAVE TO take it (it's in the contract) without any regard for your personal life. Refusal will get you a disciplinary meeting with management. 
-Many promises, but zero delivery. Expect to be disappointed ALL the time, and then get bombarded with emails by senior management to all flight attendants saying that it's our fault because we don't talk to management. Meanwhile, management is impossible to reach (unless you're in trouble!) and when you do reach them, they offer zero support.

[pros: Pays better than most part-time jobs and employees enjoy a profit-sharing check each year. You're close to your coworkers and friendships form.
cons: Can be physically demanding, most customers are rude, and the workload can be a bit overwhelming. You're expected to assist with returns, make phone calls to customers to remind them of their customer survey, or call them in regards to their online order (either their order is ready for pick up or an issue has occurred), going to the back to retrieve a customer order (sometimes the product will be heavy to where you need assistance or located at the very top shelf or missing!), regardless of the weather if a customer wants to rent a truck, you have to go outside and assist in this process, and there is no work-life balance. They hire about 5 to 6 people to work at the service desk (not at the same time) with the expectation that no one will ever get sick or request a day off or have a life outside of work.

[pros: With the extensive management program you learn how to communicate, manage people, develop leadership, plan and execute business savvy strategies. Positive environment, predictable salary, discount on clothes, create long lasting relationships, top spot to network!
cons: Extremely long hours. For managers you are looking at 6 days a week and between 50-65 hours. Certain times through the year you can take vacation. Vacation does not roll over ( use it or lose it) sometimes having a personal & professional balance is tough. There's pressure to remain positive in sales year after year.

[pros: The people I work with at store level are great.
cons: there is a re-structuring going on and the stores are losing all their good people because anyone not management will be cut down to 15 hours a week.  They expect the store to run with 5 15 hours / week people, and the manager runs the store by him/herself when no one else can be scheduled, and they expect all the work to get done on time and customer service to stay at peak performance.  Unrealistic.They are reducing pay, as well.  So people who elect to remain will have their current pay brought in line with lower paid new hires.  There is a mass exodus going on in all the stores, everywhere.  Even now, working full time,  they don't pay enough for a person to support him/herself on the pay as it is.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

Hard to find clothing items that are not RFID.

cons: Unfortunately, you can't please everyone. Some customers can become very rude and trying and management provides no support for the employees, so much so that customers are taking unfair advantageso trying to get product reduced or for free. That is very discouraging to try and voice opinions and they aren't even considered at all. There is a lot of favoritism and bias going on between some managers and employees. The pay is absurd, and there is no opportunity for growth, just more  responsibility always being tasked to you.

[pros: Working here will provide you a solid opportunity to further educate yourself as long as you can put up with all of the negatives.
cons: Major identity crisis. They're a digital company who act like they're some major financial firm. They follow the same outdated values and work ethics as Wall Street financial institutions.

Complete disrespect and apathy for their employees. They couldn’t care less for your personal life, family, health, etc. Work always comes first. 

They’ll nickel-and-dime you, and their clients, any chance they get. Be prepared for them to low-ball you and fight for your salary. Do not expect any raises or longevity perks. If you want them, you have to fight tooth-and-nail for them. 

Terrible hours. When I worked here, they expected you to start work at 9am the latest and leave at 6:30pm or 7pm the earliest. However, they would often pressure you into working even longer hours from 7:30am to 7:30pm. There is no such thing as being unavailable or unplugged in their world. When you return home at night, on the weekends and/or are on vacation, you better be available at all times. 

Contractually they offer a 1 hour lunch break but take notice if you take the entire thing. They'd prefer if you eat lunch at your desk and work the entire time. 

They love micromanagement. The senior and executive staff often demand to be  CC'ed on every email and invited to every call and meeting. 

They have no respect for their partners and put their employees in awkward and often immoral positions to push their greedy agenda. They encourage lying and often reprimand employees who they view as being too honest or good to their clients. 

Prepare for major hypocrisy as they’ll often get angry or reprimand you for doing something they often do themselves (i.e. work from home, take sick days, unplug on vacation or at night when with family and so on).] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Challenging tasks, intellectual discussions, and beer--lots of beer.  Oh, and lunch.

The employer offers free beer, as much as you want, as often as you want--but only after work hours and it must be drank on premises (obviously).

Also, if you work over the lunch hour (which you will--there are no restaurants anywhere around), then CSI will buy you lunch.  They order it in from various restaurants around the area.

Three-day weekends every other week (although that comes at a price).
cons: They are very inflexible about arriving late or leaving early--no making up the time is allowed.  Instead, you must take ""PTO""--paid time off--which is, admittedly, unlimited.  However, while it is unlimited, it is watched by management and people who take more time off than they should are negatively reviewed.  (60 hours per year seems to be the point where they start raising their eyebrows.)  

Plus the 7:30-5:30 schedule is unforgiving when it comes to family time.  Got kids?  You won't see them except for supper time and bed time.  School functions?  That comes out of the PTO.

Also, being a small company, there's no chance for promotions or advancement.] =",neutral,bad,good

Lots of opportunity to expose yourself to the music industry

It IS a sales job. in other words, if you are not interested in dealing with the public (who can sometimes be very rude and disrespectful), you will not enjoy being here. You will hear the same 3 songs played on different instruments all day.

[pros: Pet care is a fun market, and the company is full of passionate, animal-loving employees who are trying their hardest to stay positive and deliver results in an increasingly difficult situation. 

Pay is competitive for STL, and benefits (particularly maternity leave) are great. 

Pets at work! Such a fun and important piece of Purina culture.
cons: Purina is a shell of the company it was, even 5 years ago. 

While initial COVID response was positive, the push to return to 4 days a week with ""flexible Fridays""- despite multiple employee surveys disagreeing with this approach and one of the company's most challenging yet most successful years worked entirely from home- shows that management is more concerned with the image of Purina and less with the reality and their actual people . 

Talent is leaving for more flexible and better paying opportunities in droves, which would be great except... 

It is almost impossible to move up in most departments, as senior leadership just shuffles through top spots and rarely brings in new talent. We're operating in a flat/headcount neutral environment, which means when people leave the company, their positions are not backfilled and the work falls on the remaining team members. Repeat ad nauseum until the team is whittled down to two or three haggard members, who are unable to do the mandatory ""stretch assignments"" and ""networking"" required to even get your name considered for a promotion because they're drowning in 6 people's worth of work, at the same pay.

Super positive reviews on this site are likely from senior management, who are sheltered from the reality of the mid-level and entry level employees.] =",bad,bad,excellent

[pros: Cool people. great campus. Most employees are knowledgeable and professional.
cons: Good 'ol boy culture. reminds me of working for state government in regard to the fact that way too many people are involved in decisions that should be the prevue of the professional for whom is hired to make those decisions.  Way too many people have to give the 'ok' to convert someone to a 'black badge' (FTE) when that person has outperformed everyone on the FTE staff.  Thus reinforcing the good 'ol boy culture.

I honestly can say that I enjoy waking up in the morning to go to work.....Reading the above comments shocks me, I just hope people could take the time to judge for themselves and not only read sentences written by others.

[pros: Great benefits (including health, dental, vision, commuter, education), beautiful campus, always pioneering new treatments, feeling of making a difference
cons: Career opportunities
-I was promised a promotion to CRC2 for two years in a row that never came.

Compensation & benefits
-I was always scared to leave Stanford because the benefits are so good. These are the golden handcuffs, but glad I was able to break free.

Culture & Values
-People are always severely minding their own business, no sense of community, new buildings are always being constructed but you work in the darkest & dustiest corners of the oldest buildings packed in like sardines, serious lack of organization in many departments, principal investigators take on more than they can chew, managers are consistently domineering yet unknowledgeable, feeling that you are far inferior to the doctors you work with and you should never question them. I used to work at a company with an open door policy and talking to the PI was never discouraged like it is at Stanford. 

Diversity & Inclusion
-The one shining spot of Stanford, but every company in the Bay Area is good at this.

Management
-I was fortunate to have friends in other departments, and was surprised that objectively bad people were consistently put in management positions in multiple departments. People with a lack of interpersonal skills, lack of basic computer skills, lack of accountability, with a healthy dose of righteousness.

Work/Life Balance
-Stanford does offer programs like the ""Be Well"" program to encourage mindfulness, healthy eating, and exercise. However, if you don't have a manager who believes in these things, you will rarely take advantage of this program and other programs like it.] =",neutral,neutral,excellent

[pros: Amazing employee discount (40%) on all VSB products, and great 20% discount on other company products. Management team is small and you can usually get to know them very well. You get to know other wellness professionals really well so its easy to find out about the best Gym in town or who gives out donation Yoga classes. You meet tons of cool people (forgiving the rude meathead or stuck up triathlete) that want to find some answers or get their health on track
cons: Unless you get a keyholder or higher job you are pretty much doomed to  or less hours a week with only 4 hours at a time. so unless somehow you have the nicest manager in the world you will be stuck to whatever crazy hours they can give you. I only got more hours at one time because we promoted someone to a different store that was opening and it left us without another H.E.

The finance, shipping, and CDW badged vendor partners are often very hard to get a hold of which causes you to lose deals waiting on an answer. 
They tell you in the academy that is is not about #'s but that is not true.

cons: Huge, massive company that doesn't care about its employees. If an employee has a positive experience, it's only a result of having a great manager -- but beware, reorganizations happen about every 3 months. There's a lot of cross-hiring as well as attrition, so your team could look radically different from year to year, and even month to month. There are also a lot of processes that are done ""just because we've always done it this way"" - so be prepared for ridiculous, anti-business wastefulness. Last but not least, nasty politics and backstabbing - and an Ethics team that is busy, but lacks fangs depending upon which executive is involved in whatever ethics violation (e.g., sexual harassment).

Amazingly supportive for an oil company (HQ in California and you can tell).
cons: Very buttoned down and bland culture. All the personality has been scrubbed out...just not that fun on a day to day basis. Some of the office locations are so boring. Too quiet, no chatter, few friendships. Career path is mostly self directed...it's on you to figure out how to climb the ladder. Despite all the talk about diversity & inclusion there has not been much progress. Management team isn't really interested in 'diversity of thought' and don't appreciate opinions that run counter to management strategies.

cons: It is really very sad to see how parts of the business are being destroyed by toxic managers and complicit senior management. This is particularly the case in the Innovation department. True talent is being pushed away and manipulative managers are being allowed to bully employees and destroy morale. When this is brought up to company's senior management or HR not only no action is taken to tackle the problem but the individual brining this up can say goodbye to their career at RS.  All they are concerned about is their image. Just look at a number of fake Glassdoor reviews aimed at increasing the score and pushing the true reviews down the order.

-The store manager's power was greatly diminished due to the creation of a 'branch manager', who played heavily into the store and small-town politicking. 
-Ever increasing open hours with not enough corresponding staff hours leading to constantly being short handed. 
-Pandemic response was dismal. Cared more about optics than safety. 'Hero pay' was done after a month. No safety net or plan for sick staff, expected us to use sick time, which not everyone had.

[pros: +The kids are great to work with equipped with very colorful personalities. You feel good about enriching their lives.
+Immediate coworkers (NOT your managers) are cool and liven up the place.
+Accommodating to your college/outside work schedule.
+Geoffrey Canada's mission is pretty good I suppose.
cons: Where do we start? I've been working for this agency for a while now and I've experienced a multitude of nonsense.

1. Extremely unorganized. There will be times where you have to put together an entire performance with the kids on the same day of finding out.
2. Short-changing of hours. You are restricted to a set amount of hours, if you go over you will not get payed for those hours. Apparently you are a volunteer even if you are promised extra hours to begin with. Here's the cherry on top, your hours may get messed up too.
3. Too much favoritism/nepotism. I can count on one hand how many people didn't know my supervisors prior to working there and if you don't expect to get shafted.
4. Zero stability. Thanks to a high turnover rate, your employment status is on thin ice. 
5. A strong rift between day school and after-school program. Day school definitely looks down on after-school as an after thought. No synergy between both.
6. Lack of consistency. Too many changes in program and management within a matter of a few months. 
8. Very unprofessional. I remember some workers were publicly fired during a ""team building"" employee training. How ironic.
9. No proper discipline. Children get away with A LOT in comparison to other schools.

There's much more problems as the other reviews pointed out. I honestly want this agency to improve, but there's so much work that needs to be done for HCZ to become a prosperous work environment.] =",good,bad,terrible

[pros: Working at the Quality Assurance Center definitely gave me experience in maintaining aseptic techniques. It pays fairly well if you're a recent college graduate trying to gain experience in laboratories. There's always another skill to learn in the laboratory.

[pros: Benefits are very good compared to other corporations. The company has a pension plan that vests you 100% after 3 years of employment (it used to be 5 years). Work-life balance is valued greatly and managers are pretty flexible and generous with the need for time off and vacation requests. This includes maternity/paternity leave as well.  It is a good place to learn about the financial industry and become experienced within it. Compensation like bonuses and raises are good, if you get it.
cons: Metrics, metrics, and more metrics. You are just another cow producing milk. You don't produce enough, you are written up. You could go on for months of hitting your numbers and doing well and 2 bad months, you are on a verbal warning.  They constantly ""raise the bar"" (the company's term) on you as what you have to accomplish in a day. They expect more and more out of you every day. What is worse, you have ""coordinators"" (aka supervisors) who can't even properly account for your work and turn that over to the manager without telling you or advising you that you are not doing good. They will provide you with different totals than what they give to the manager. Next thing you know you are written up. If a coordinator doesn't like you, they will make sure you don't hit your numbers every month by assigning your more difficult requests that may take longer or don't give your more ""points"". They are cowards because they know they will not have to face you when you have to have a ""conversation"" with your manager about your performance. You have to account for your own work heavily, and document everything in order to combat the possibility of being written or fired over your performance!  Also, butt kissers, brown nosers and informants will get a promotion or special job duty above you, despite how hard you may work or how well you perform above them. And if you perform well, but may appear to be a career threat to someone, management  will move you to a hated and despised department in order to beef up the numbers and set you up for failure. And yes, I have applied for lateral positions myself, and was told I was ""over-qualified"" for the position and was even asked to take a 15-20% pay cut if I accepted it. What kind of logic is that!  And from department to department, even if you are doing similar work, they account for your work in entirely different ways. And in some cases, what the other department does with your work request that you have completed properly and on time, can impact you and bring down your numbers if they don't handle it in time.

Management is self-absorbed and arrogant, particularly mid level management. They relish the fact they have power to fire you or lay you off for poor performance. They look good to directors and VPs when they get rid of ""poor performers"".   Directors and VPs are so happy they make the money they make, they could care less if you are a good employee who hit a bad streak - OFF WITH YOUR HEAD! 

Then the company thinks they are saving money by outsourcing when in the long run, they spend more. Outsourcing works in some cases, but not for a financial company like this one.] =",good,terrible,none

Not great for long-term career growth due to frequent lay-offs, reorgs, office closing etc. You must be adept at reading the tea leaves of who and what projects senior management favors.
cons: Bloated marketing & G&A organization. Views engineers as a cost to reduce, not as the core of the company. Recurring annual layoffs. Killing projects before they have a chance to come to fruition. Firing producers not middle-managers.] =",good,bad,bad

[pros: It was a job they hired me immediately.
cons: It's only 7.25 an hour part time but with such low pay I often would  work close to 80 hours a week no over time no benefits only for the simple fact I had a family to support. Then asked if I got over time I was told that I worked 20 hours stocking 20 hours cashier 20 unloading etc. It got old quick and once I found a better job I quit so I could find some thing that didnt take advantage of my work ethic. And most of the time corporate was there to inspect shelfs and to see who was stealing...items, time. Breaking things on purpose.. 2  10 minute breaks every shift and one 30 minute break... ugh.

[pros: Salary is better than other Indian IT companies.
If you can play politics and flatter your manager, this is the best place for you.
Good for people who want to become ""Manager"" in 3-4 years experience
cons: Not a company for bright technical resource.
Lots of politics and obduracy.
Higher management is pathetic.
No HR to approach. The HR team is managed and controlled by Senior management.
It's a CAREER KILLER. You will find yourself nowhere if you stay in this company for a long. For freshers it's a trap.
Promotions are never done in merit/performance basis.

If you start in retail, you will be given the opportuntiy to manage much sooner then your peers.  You cannot be afraid of sales and having an outgoing personality is a must!

[pros: It was a good learning experience especially if you are promoted to a management role (shift manager, MT, or Store Manager). You will get a to learn and improve skills in time management, multi-tasking, and prioritizing-which are great transferable skills. Most of my co-workers were amazing, they were like my second family. Everyone was very hard working. I worked there for over 5 years, I loved the regular customers that I saw 2-3 times per week. Retail can be a thankless job; but, I have received comments from customers (every now and then) who recognize my hard work and thank me for work-which is probably one of the best things I loved about Aldi. The pay is way above many other retail store wage rates, and trust me you will be working hard for that higher pay. Health benefits and 401k benefits were great as well. In closing ,if you are willing to learn new things, take on challenging tasks, work hard, and provide excellent customer service then you will succeed. If not, I suggest you look elsewhere.
cons: You will work hard. By hard I don't mean you will be sitting at the register all day ringing up customer orders. You will be stocking shelves. You will be stocking bread, meat, and produce; cleaning, helping with merchandising, inventory, taking out trash. The job is very physically demanding. With that said, it WILL start to take a toll on your body. Although you will learn a lot, this job is not good for long term employment, definitely not to retire from-IMO if you work at the store level. Movement beyond Shift Manager or MT can be quite difficult for those that want to move up. All stores operate on very slim staff (hence why you get paid more), so when call-outs happen or when people quit, it can be a headache to find coverage.] =",bad,bad,excellent

[pros: Total review (pros & cons)
I was an Account Sales Engineer selling vision solutions (cameras, software, services) to OEM’s and end users.  I worked closely with an SSE (Sensor Sales Engineer) who focused on Dataman readers, entry level sensors & camera and handheld readers.  I held this position for 5 years.
Your first year starts with a fairly easy quota.  You will also attend “boot camp” usually in the Natick, MA headquarters.  Boot Camp is meant to prepare you with the technical aptitude to sell Cognex products but in the end it’s a waste of time.  You really learn on the job.  You will have Application Engineers who assist you in solving vision applications with: correct resolution camera; correct optics; correct lighting; software tools to complete the customers inspection criteria.  
You report to a District Sales Manager who has 6-8 employees (usually 3 ASE / 3 SSE) in a given geography.  Like any company, some are good, some are lousy.  They report to a Regional Manager who has 3-4 DSM’s reporting to him.  Regional Manager reports to the VP of Sales.
In your first year, they really want you to learn, learn, learn!  Learn the cameras; lighting techniques; optical techniques; learn the software and how to put all these components together and do a demo in front of the customer.  You’ll attend software training classes; travel to the TEC (Technical Evaluation Center) in Nashville; ride with other ASE’s and begin to get to know your distribution partners and most importantly, learn how to use the CRM – Cognex uses Microsoft Dynamics, referred internally as “Salesbook”.  More on this later.
You won’t feel too much pressure to “hit your numbers” in your first year.  You’ll make pretty good money, say $115 - $125K and you’ll feel pretty good about yourself.  Everybody will like you.
Then year two starts.  Welcome to the pressure cooker!  Being a public company within a small niche, from the CEO on down its all about hitting numbers within your accurate sales forecast. The CEO previously worked for Danaher, which is their culture as well.  When you’re in Natick for your boot camp, take notice of the many flat screens on the walls of the sales marketing department.  These list every salesman against their monthly, quarterly and yearly quota and other performance metrics and KPI’s (key performance indicators).  When your name and statistics are green, you’re in great shape.  When they are in red, people start looking over your shoulder.  The longer your name is in red, the greater the pressure applied to you.  Regardless of your past success or what your sales funnel says.
Its all about Salesbook.  Cognex is obsessed with Salesbook.  You will enter all of your call report notes each day / week and constantly massage and change your 90 day forecast to be 100% accurate (which is impossible).  You will spend 1-2 hours per day just managing salesbook.  Leads come in through salesbook and the opportunity grows (or is killed) from there.  Youll be watching football games on Sunday while your working salesbook.  There are these KPI’s I spoke of earlier driven within salesbook that populate back to those flat screens in Natick. Some KPI’s you know about, others only management knows about.  One I found about was how much I spent monthly on customer lunches!  Somebody sits in Natick thinking about this.  Hotel nights too!
Constant turnover. I had 4 different District Managers (DM) within 5 years.  It’s nearly impossible for the DM to become familiar with you, your customers & prospects in just one year.  If a DM isn’t hitting his numbers, he’s out.  Sometimes on the street but mostly moved into another position where their not responsible for a district anymore.  Same with Regional Managers.  I had two of them during my 5 years.  And this has nothing to do with a growing company.  This is the reality within Cognex.  They cut heads when there is a sniff of an economic downturn.
OK what do they do well?  They have great vision software that integrates with the smart cameras.  You’ll never have a problem getting an appointment or pushing your distributors into an account.  Their products are very reliable and have an excellent reputation within industrial automation.  They pay well.  At quota you will make $145 - $160.  If you have a blowout year, you will be capped and max out around $185.   They pay expenses well.  They use Concur for expense submission and monitoring which is a great product.  They pay mileage for your own car, which I prefer and its very fair.  I never had an expense dispute or problem.  
If you’re single without the responsibility for a family, you would do OK in Cognex.  If you have a family you will burnout within 5 years.  That’s what happened to me.  Check out LinkedIn to verify how long people last in these roles.  Its pretty eye opening.
Hope this helps.

They want growth constantly, but give you no support to have this growth executed properly from the start, most new business will have issues from the very beginning. Rather it be the gases required will not be delivered complete from the start, or the pricing will not be entered correctly by the pricing team, there will be fees that neither you nor the customer negotiated on, the plant in which is in charge of the area for deliveries will not make a delivery and will not notify the Salesman of the issue.

[pros: Free lunches once in a while
cons: For the B-Line division in Calgary, no matter how hard, Accurate, Safe, and effective you, or you co-workers that drudge through the trenches with you work, the company will only hire someone new based on Representation over qualifications, and they will skip right over the heavy lifting, and get you to be the grunt to do all the work while they train someone outside to only do the wields. 

Just 4 years ago the Boss just give the staff the wielding gun, time to learn and off your set wielding because of seniority and years spent doing the hard work. Just 2 years ago there was still at least a wielding/ lifting rotation so the staff could take a break. now even after being trained in house like many before you and doing all the lifting you'll be passed over. There is no reward for advancement to become a wielder, so we've lost countless good Temporary workers, as well as full time assembly staff because of this hiring practice. 

Even those that got the golden deal left after they took the experience with them resulting in a net loss of both the new hire and the person that got pasted over .  No one has a wielding ticket or an official red seal because if they did, they wouldn't work for 24/h, its aluminum anyways so its specialized it takes 2 weeks to train a new person, rather than let you, after all your years slaving to do it.  

If you're are a wielder, you should find a higher paying place because you will do Intense lifting too that won't even be worth the effort, but if you do make it, you'll get just past over, so there's no point.] =",good,terrible,bad

[pros: Merrill has a good name in the finance industry, which makes it desirable from a resume perspective.  Where ever you go the name Merrill Lynch is known, and they seem to have unlimited funding for anything related to marketing and public relations.  If you are a financial advisor they have some very good programs.  The apprenticeship program lasts about 2 years, and many of the candidates are from the interns that are hired for summer jobs.  The interns are treated more like trainees then employees, and get the benefits of spending time with management that regular employees never get a chance at. Often, interns are given choice assignments because it's politically visible to show that the manager is 'helping the community'.
cons: When you work at Merrill, you first hear about the Merrill culture. ""Mother Merrill"".
The real culture at Merrill does not encourage original thinking, presentating ideas, sharing information, or growing as an individual.  Status is everything, from what you wear to what you drive.
The culture is disappointing because while they claim to provide opportunities for women and minorities, what you really have are specific groups that are actually quite prejudiced.  Most of the ethnic groups only hire from their own culture, so if you get a manager who's from X-country, he will only hire people from X-country, while an American manager would be required to hire from several ethnic cultures.  And because they count 'ethnic' as one group, they can say dept 1 has 10 ethnic credits, even if all 10 are from one country.  This is not diversity. A true multicultural environment would enable diverse people to work in one group, not separate pockets of cultures within one large department.
And finally, the biggest problem is that management is shifted every 6 months, so as soon as you establish your skills and value to a manager, that manager is moved and you have to start all over.] =",good,terrible,bad

[pros: Only pro would be the discount but then again you spend all of your money shopping, and have to get a SaksFirst credit card to make purchases. Which had a high interest rate and basically screws you over in the end. 
Other pro would be my co workers, I had an amazing team and it never felt competitive or sharky.
Paid average dollar amount for holidays and vacation so that’s actually good money if you are selling well.
Good benefits. I had the top level and had 90% coverage with mostly everything
cons: No room for growth.
Pressure to have customers open credit cards (I didn’t apply to work for Capital One)
Pressure to cross sell (sorry, I didn’t get hired as a personal shopper) and then you get into trouble for being in other departments.
Can’t special order items for customers.
If it’s not online and out of sizes in store you are screwed for lack of a better term.
Management is insane in ladies shoes. Nice person, but a micro manager who lets stress get the better of her. Unprofessional and when her team tries to voice their concerns she gets defensive and doesn’t listen to anything they say.
New upper management has no leniency when it comes to customer issues. Even if it is a mistake on our stores end, they will still say no to the customer.
Inconsistent when it comes to dress code. One day they say you can wear jeans and then the next no, off the shoulder and then no, designer sneakers and then no. So you spend your own money on wardrobe pieces you eventually can’t wear to work, but as management says “you make enough money” so that’s okay.
Management is never available when you need them and unfortunately the POS limits you to things you can do, so if you have a customer issue you are running around the store like a mad person until you find someone or the customer says they will come back.
While associates can’t take breaks together, two to three managers will go at one time. There is 12-15 of us and 2-3 of you.
Management doesn’t want to help with any issues, one time a manager said they were in a meeting and I saw them downstairs getting coffee.
Basically, an anxiety inducing workplace where multiple people have broken down and cried/had panic attacks because of management and the workplace environment] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: Great employee benefits! You get employee discounts on hotels and insurance benefits are fantastic.
cons: - Favoritism in the workplace. People hired for positions/ given promotions based on favoritism or who they know, rather than work ethic. 
- When there are zero consequences for bad work ethic and zero (genuine) appreciation for good work ethic, there is ZERO motivation.
- Tardiness is unacceptable (understandably so, obviously), but managers need to learn to lead by example. Alot of the time managers / directors would come in late, take extended lunches, leave for ""hair appointments"", etc. - but still be clocked in the full shift. This makes for horrible moral.] =",neutral,terrible,bad

however, it is never a clear cut program and more items are removed or not discounted each day.
cons: Very low pay. No real training except poor web program, inconsistent schedules, Bad work hours, No work -life balance, Only allowed 10 minute breaks, Pushed to sell high interest credit cards, Told to lie about origin of web orders. No pay raises, or talk of pay increases. No janitor or cleaning service so employees must do all cleaning including restrooms, garbage, floors, etc. Stock is moved around the store constantly so employees and regular customers have problems locating items. Managers are moved to different stores so there is no consistency. Management does not listen, care about, or trust employees. You are simply a body to fill a shift. Management is very well paid, while the people who do the work barely make enough to survive. If you are called in to help out, you do not make enough to cover the commute. Super high employee turnover, most employees do not stay over 6 months. Some employees take on extra responsibility doing special tasks like, bike building, lifting extra heavy equipment, and selling guns yet they do not get extra pay for the added risk.

[pros: Working out of the Pennyslvania Office.
You won't find entry level call-center positions that pay as well as Delta Dental of Pennsylvania in Central PA to do a ridiculously easy but ridiculously mundane job. The union gives a great starting salary and as long as you come in and do your job and not delve into unsavory practices and bad work ethics, management will bend over backwards for you and work with you.

The Job provides gainful employment and is a good starting point for those out of high school/college.  But you are not going to like it.
cons: Where to begin. 

The job functions.  You get paid to repeat the same thing over and over again.  A mind-numbing and life-draining cocktail of benefits, claims, caller dissatisfaction and plain stupidity.  It doesn't sound that bad until get a provider's office who asks you to repeat the same information over and over because they weren't paying attention and places you abruptly on hold without asking first, and that 5 minute call turns into 15 minutes.  And when you think you're done, they speak the dreaded words ""Alright, are you ready for another account?"" with the expectation that you will give them all the same information again for another patient. And that's just the tip, because they may have 5-6 more accounts after that they want you to look up on the same call. Mind you, you are graded on your call time.  And in recent times, it appears  provider offices have been calling in for more and more accounts on a single call, making it difficult to recover from and still meet your call time metrics.

As well, More job roles and more job functions keep getting piled on to the already stressed out representatives which creates an incredibly stressed out work environment. 

Ahhh the environment.  Normally, in an Union setting your seniority within the company determines many things such as vacation availability, and your shift.   However with Delta Dental of Pennsylvania,  that's only applies to a very small degree.   

The call-center is divided into several projects, each dedicated to a certain client.  And it's complete luck of the draw which project you're stuck on. Your seniority plays no roll in which project you were placed on. 

One of those projects has scheduling and shift availability based on our local time. A nice 8 - 5 work day.   One of the other projects has scheduling and shift availability based on a time zone that is behind us by several hours, meaning that they need to staff more people later in the day for that project.  That makes sense. However, your seniority is only tied to the project you were randomly elected to be on.  Which means if you drew the short straw and were placed on the late shift should it be disadvantageous, your seniority means absolutely nothing to the other project.  So if they're hiring early shifts, or having shift bids down to an earlier shift, you cannot participate, meaning your ability to get an earlier shift have been greatly diminished due to poor company policy. 

Those 2 projects don't pull from the same seniority, meaning  someone with the company for 10 years can be stuck working till 7 PM on one project, but someone who has been with the company for 6 months to a year can get to go home at 4:30-5:00 pm on the local project.  

When you sign on with Delta Dental, it is not made immediately or clearly apparent which project you were elected for.  If you have a family, you can say goodbye to them if you get put on the project adjusted for a different time zone, as you will never see them again in the afternoon. Also, if you want to switch projects,  you must jump through a ridiculous number of hoops to try and switch and bid into an open position on the other project,  and then wait and hope for a shift bid which is not guaranteed to come. And that waiting list of people wanting to switch is quite long.    As well, managerial staff will try to lightly dissuade you, misdirect and mislead you from switching.

This creates an environment where you see a large number of incredibly miserable people on one side of the building who are stuck working till 8pm every day thanks to Mandatory overtime  that must be worked to compensate for a deficiency in the other call-centers staffing.  And on the other half of the building, there are people who were just barely employed leaving at 4:30 PM to go enjoy their son or daughter's baseball game.  

Smoke-break sources, opinions and conversations, along with my own personal opinion have generally concluded that many on the alternate project feel like 2nd Rate employees who aren't seen as equals to those on the native project even though they had no choice on the matter on which project they were joining, and that their time and seniority under the union are all for naught. 

If you don't mind working late, that isn't much of a problem.  But it is incredibly inconvenient for anybody with a family to go home to, as everyone will be in bed by the time you get home. 

Speaking of which.  The Pennsylvania call-center works in conjunction with 2 other call centers, and none of them can work together and the representatives between the 3 call centers are not on the same page.  It almost feels like there's some malevolent competition between the 3 call centers  where they try and sabotage each other to make themselves look like the best call center.   

As such, one person can call in with 1 question and get 7 different answers because nobody is on the same page.    This results in a whole lot of really angry callers.   

So what happens is that you end up with this vicious and incredibly common circumstance several times a day where a caller called in, got a representative who has no idea what a prophylaxis is or a filing,  or what a claim is for that matter, transfers it, it then gets picked up by someone else who gives an apathetic shrug  and says to resubmit the claim.  The provider resubmits the claim, gets another reject/denial for it being a duplicate, calls back in, may get the same run around in which  history is doomed to repeat itself and the escalates to a supervisor...  or by a stroke of sheer luck, they'll find someone with still a small amount of integrity and sanity left who has not given into despair, sees the issue for what it really is and says 'I'll be happy to help you with this.'  And the caller is either going to react in 2 very different ways.  They're going to be incredibly angry that it wasn't fixed 2 weeks prior, or they will be incredibly grateful. So grateful, in fact, they might right you a nice letter to your supervisor.  Which is great, especially as a morale boost.  Or, from now on, every time they call in they exclusively ask for you as you're their new messiah or something.

The whole scenario above could be avoided if there wasn't so much segregation and everyone was put on the same page.   Or if people had a real incentive to try and work hard.  Because as unions dictate, whether you are at the top of the pack, or scrape by with minimal effort, we're all considered equal, which doesn't really motivate or provide any incentive at all for working hard.  It promotes poor work ethic, cutting corners, cheating and avoiding responsibility, which leads to termination and a relatively high turnover rate. However, again, we do have great salaries and decent benefits thanks to the Union.  It's a double edged sword.

Communication.  Communication is virtually non-existent at Delta Dental, in the customer service department/callcenter.  It's not uncommon to get a memo days, if not weeks after a change has already gone into effect.  Or for a change to go completely unnoticed by everyone until an issue happens with it. 

Systems:  Poor/ancient equipment not capable of handling the most basic of tasks without sputtering and stuttering plague our desks while resource intensive security and bloated updates bring them to a crawl. Our systems run like frozen molasses, if Frozen Molasses had a dial up connection. Prehistorically preserved Amber flows faster than our systems. That might be a bit of an exaggeration but you get the idea.  And this affects our performance.

Poor  processing policy rules, bugs and technical issues run rampant with some bugs still not being resolved in years.   There are people who haven't been able to access our website for years.  And due to simple bugs in the processing rules for services, there are claims that reject en'mass. And we'll send them back for a Level II representative to look at, and they'll send it on to the people who reprocess it, but you can report it till you're blue in the face to your managers and supervisors asking them to submit a troubleshooting ticket to have the root problem fixed, and they may, but the ones responsible for fixing it will be nowhere to be found, and the path of least resistance will be followed because it appears resolving system issues is too much work. 

Employee Favoritism: We get paid to take calls. That is our job.  We sit down, we put on an ancient and grossly uncomfortable headset that will give you headaches and put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on/around your ears., and we take calls. that is our job function.   However, my time with Dental have shown me that there are those favored ones.  Unexceptional employees given exceptional responsibilities and tasks due to favoritism. Opportunities provided to those who did not earn it on merit, where those who do work incredibly hard are looked due to some form of drama.  Yeah, it happens.   it's not uncommon to be taking back to back calls with an idle time of 2% while the person next to you is reading a book or chatting with one of their buddies a few rows over with an idle time of 10-20% or even more. 

Consistency:  Lastly, the only thing consistent is the inconsistency. Of course it's a dynamic and ever changing environment, however there's a right way and a wrong way to go about it.  And Delta Dental definitely chose the wrong way.  As the saying Goes. Prior Proper Planning Prevents Poor Performance. 

Right now, the direction delta dental is going is like that of a blind man throwing knives at a spinning target with the collective we call the callcenter employees pinned to it.

This review may be harsh and it may air a lot of dirty laundry, but it's how I feel as an employee of many years in the call center and what I've observed.  I would only recommend working for delta dental's call center as a means of gainful employment until you find a position that makes you happy.  Otherwise, you'll end up like me.  Wondering where 7-8 years have gone, with little to nothing to show for it other than more wrinkles, gray hair, always tired and run down, emotionally, mentally and empathetically exhausted and time lost that I wish I could have back to spend with my family instead of being stuck at work till late.] =",terrible,terrible,excellent

[pros: - Flexible hours. You can choose to work WHATEVER hours in the day you like, on whatever days you like.

- Pay isn't that bad if students rate you - I average about £12-13 per hour which is decent enough, what with the fact there is no travel costs etc.

- Work from home - very comfortable!

- It's quite nice to teach a variety of information to people, and 9 times of out 10 the students are very nice.

- If you smile, you earn more :)

- They always pay on time, never late.

- UPDATE - they have introduced a policy wherein once you work 1000 hours for the company, they raise you're end-of-the-month paycheck by 5%. And if you have a fixed schedule, you get an additional 2%.
cons: - Been going downhill. Company has lost any feeling of warmth for it's employees and is constantly introducing additional ways to discipline their employees over menial things.

- For example, if the students think you are on your phone at all during the session, you are fired.

- Let's say that you booked sessions for thursday, and then on wednesday you realised you Internet was down and you can't work on thursday. You cancel the sessions according to company policy, but they will not do anything. You'll just get an email threatening to fire you because you ""Missed"" you're class. The session cancellation process just does not work, EVER.

- No rhyme or reason to the amount of classes you get per day. One day you'll get 2 classes and make £20 in a day, the next day you'll get 6 big classes and earn £100 in 6 hours.

- No reliable wage.

- Students don't leave feedback most of the time. This makes up most of your wage, and will be almost £ per £ the same amount as your hourly rate by the end of the month.] =",bad,neutral,excellent

cons: do not work here!!!! this place caused me depression and anxiety.
you are literally a number to them not a human being.  
I was constantly being pulled in for meetings over the smallest thing, I ended up staying here over 12 months simply because they eroded my confidence in myself so much by making me feel worthless that I almost gave up on life.

They kept using the approach of 'trying to teach grandmother to suck eggs' and making me have coaching,  not that I required the coaching because I lacked skill but I rather lacked the will as the fact I was being paid barely enough to survive let alone to be able to plan for any kind of future had simply eroded my spirit.

This was picked up on when my calls we're listened to but rather than them asking if there was anything bothering me they tried to teach me customer service skills as though I was 16 yet I am a fully grown adult.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Rackspace has remnants of a once great culture.  There are terrific people that work there that still put customer first and live the company values.
cons: The culture at Rackspace is rapidly declining largely due to poor Senior leadership.  The greatness of Rackspace is a value system that puts the customer first.  That is no longer the case.  It is Stock holder first.  The standard SLT approach is do more with less. Senior Leadership only promotes leaders to Mid Management who share that theme and do not stand up for the customer.  That worked for a period of time.  It has reached the point where we are now doing less with less as we can no longer do more.  The result is we are doing less with less and failing to keep our promise to customers.  That word is on the streets and has brought a serious decline in growth.] =",terrible,terrible,bad

[pros: Excellent paid time off including vacation days, sick leave, paid holidays, and a paid week off in December. Great benefits. Some positions have the option to apply to work remotely for up to two days per week.
cons: Lots of red tape and political bureaucracy. A toxic work environment for introverted staff unless you are well-liked and accepted by the popular extroverted staff members. Poor communication between upper administration and staff members. Some staff members feel under-appreciated and overworked while others are treated with respect and get whatever they ask for. Low pay. They are all about meeting their numbers, admitting as many students as possible, and hiring more and more faculty, without creating additional staff positions to support these increases.

[pros: The only good thing about VCA is the employee discount for services for your own pet.
cons: Low pay compared to the same jobs in the industry, management overworks technicians and receptionists with no acknowledgement or recognition.

Even when short staffed and overworked, animals are crammed into the clinics, resulting in poor care for the animals.

[pros: Promoting and distributing clean energy is a good thing.  There is a sense of ""I've done something good today"" at the end of a shift.
cons: Some of the management lacks experience, confidence, and competence.  This leads to them fearing that those whom they ""manage"" may be advanced above them within the company. The result is some managers spending their time discounting the contributions of their best reps while simultaneously taking credit for any and all success that the sales team has. Promises are made and then never fulfilled. Sales Reps have no tracking system to ensure they are paid for all of their enrollments and bonuses.  Promised expense reimbursements are not paid.

[pros: I used to love my job.  Interesting projects depending on the group you are in, talented people around every corner. Vast amounts of brick, mortar, equipment, resources and history.  Some opportunity to learn from people with incredible specialized skills. Battelle promotes community charity work.
cons: Costs are too high for the industry, support staff heavy. Management lost sight of what drives commercial industry, wants back in, but culture is incompatible. Risk-averse environment hostile to new thinking. Clicks, much like high school, nearly everyone is born and raised in Ohio (to the non-Ohio born, you will be labeled a non-team player) Best to kiss up to project managers, assignments are based on favoritism and seniority, not skill. Technology updates are badly needed in some areas, beyond stagnation, to the point of loosing important capabilities. Buildings regularly being torn down. Pension plan was dropped for younger employees, kept for the older employees creating a caste system of sorts. Health plan was great, now mediocre and going away by 2017 to HSA only. Client work is coveted, non-client or internal customer work will backwater your career, and put you first-in-line for forced PTO (or worse) when sequester or cyclical hard times call.

[pros: Stay away from this place. I mean it!!!  including (south center location and the core)
cons: One of the worst working experience I ever had. You will be working your butt off selling their not so good hair products, Up selling your services and not be recognized of your hard work. I have never felt abused working in this place. Its unbelievable how this place is being run.  Between employees there's hardly any communication or team work. You will feel this ego going on in the salon. Everyone works on their own (no one talks to each others, work individually)  Can you imagine going to work every single day in a environment like this?? Management will hardly Support their employees to grow. They will cut your hours out of no where, screw up your paychecks, Call you in the morning not to show up for your shift because you have no clients. I ve seen many employees just walk and go. including managers, hosts (front desk) and hairdressers. Its insane.. There will be no team meetings. No perks. Absolutely nothing!!!  Calling it 5 stars high end salon?? Yeah that must be a joke... everything about this company is pretty messed up.  I suggest anyone to please  stay away from EC. Look elsewhere to work where they will promote you better and make you feel valuable to them. where this place has none of it. You will pretty much feel just like a number and being paid minimum wage.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

[pros: Maybe the hours were ok but still no pros at all.
cons: Where shall I start, firstly,  anyone who goes to the interview will be hired because the turnover at this place is crazy! everyone leaves! The only good part about this job is the training and as soon as you get to the ""floor"" it will be hell! you are given pointless training because when customers don't want to buy, they just don't! and we as salespeople are trying to persuade pensioners to buy products they don't want! 

Secondly, the targets are a joke, managers think it's so easy I would love to see them try.. and it's not just the sales target you have 4 separate targets to hit. 

Thirdly, every single person there hates their job and are just doing it to get by whilst they find another job! the commission is the worst I have ever seen. 

EXTRA CONS - toilet breaks are times and you are made to feel guilty for taking more than one or two toilet breaks in the whole shift as this is a KPI! (actually told by manager that if it was their choice they would not even allow toilet breaks fml lol)

-you get 2 - 10min breaks which are barely enough to get a drink of water as you need to be at your desk at least 1 min earlier in order to keep your adherence
- Clean desk policy where no paper is allowed on the desk or on yourself, even your own wallet or cards need to be in your locker, literally nothing at your desk apart from a clear bottle of water or a cup! 
- Feels more like a prison than a workplace.

[pros: I work part-time at leeds vicar lane site in the bar and restraunt area. As a full time student the jobs flexibility fits perfect. I love how not one shift is the same.

I've stayed much longer than I ever expected because I love working with all the smart, nice, customer-focused people here. Great benefits, and family-friendly. Work-life balance will depend on your role, but the culture encourages it overall. Yes, they really do let you take your sabbatical!
cons: Like any other place I've worked, you're kind of on your own when it comes to figuring out a move-up in position, so be proactive and ask for what you need. Comp adjustment practices are less than ideal as they are currently only twice per year. For most people in practice, it's once a year. There's also an ongoing gripe internally about things moving too slow--some of this is for good reason in a complex and highly regulated environment. But some projects are unnecessarily glacial due to overly ambitious scope, lack of resources, etc.] =",excellent,excellent,excellent

[pros: Very good monetary benefits pre-covid period (Good Salary / Bonuses / Quarterly Payout / Birthday Gift / CNY vouchers / Incentive Trip / Wellness Program)
cons: For the department I worked in, there were mass resignations when I tendered. HOD was micro managing the team. Appeared to let the staff to take charge, but would need to propose different types of suggestions for HOD's approval. Worst of all, we were required to present in PowerPoint slides even for simple suggestions. Biggest issue was the HOD could not make up her mind after the presentation of ideas. So the team had endless meetings/discussions, with no conclusions. This process kept repeating itself, day after day. As a result, many colleagues would OT (after work, on weekends, on PH, on leave) to clear their day to day (routine) operation stuff. Whereas the HOD would knock off on time on days HOD had appointments, yet the team had to continue slogging. 

During circuit breaker, working from home was the worst thing ever. Had to on web cam during office hours, cannot mute the mic. Had to ask for permission before going toilet break, cannot disappear from the screen for too long. Had to login 5 min before official start work time. As mic was not mute, it was particularly noisy especially since there's were more than 10 of us, with family members at the background. This includes the time when HOD was chatting with particular colleagues or scolding someone. Basically, we are being monitored and it was HELL. 

Also politics within the department. Pretend not to know means you can get lesser work? Junior staff are working so hard and we have two seniors spending time chatting away and next moment say that you have no time to do work? One of them even has time to catch up on the news every now and then and play games during working hours?  

The company seems perfect on the surface but totally rotten inside. There may be few departments that are ok but still, join at your own risk. Most of the colleagues have worked there for years. Will leave the culture to your own imagination.] =",terrible,terrible,terrible

[pros: Until the new CEO came on board and started making drastic operational changes the store was busy with happy customers and a pleasant working environment - lots of staff events and encouraging management.  Now the only pros are no early openings or late closings and the employee discount increased by 5%.
cons: Since February the new CEO's cost cutting measures have eliminated over 50% of the checkout locations (including the customer service desk) and have caused massive customer complaints of not being able to get any help and make store recovery a daily nightmare for the associates. Pricing team cuts have resulted in store wide pricing inaccuracies and further confusion for customers and associates.  Severe drop in customer traffic and significantly greater daily, even hourly, pressure to sell sell sell credit makes for an anxious and unhappy work environment.  Supervisors and staff losing jobs and those remaining losing many hours have resulted in very low morale - some of the better employees are resigning as soon and they find other jobs.] =",bad,terrible,bad

[pros: Excellent Experience.  If you are going to work in the mental health field, from early on, you will get excellent front line experience that will stick with you for the rest of your career.  The challenges and difficulties of the job help foster a team envrinment where everyone works together to get the job done.  Since Youth Villages is leading the way nationally in child welfare services and innovation, you have the opportunity to gain a unique perspective and get it on what is being nationally recognized as a leading model and organization.  Simply the excellent name Youth Villages has built for itself can be an asset in your future career if you find yourself needing to change organizations. Its hard work, from top to bottom, the nature of the work is hard.  However, Youth Villages will afford you the opportunity and experience to make the most out of it.  As you progress in your career in or outside of Youth Villages, you won't be basing your career off a bunch of stuff you read in a book in some class.  Rather, you will be basing it off first hand experiences that you get working at Youth Villages.  The company often promotes from within, so advancement opportunities abound, particularly with its expansion to other states.  I started Youth Villages 12 years ago having no idea or intention that I would stay as they were just the first people that offered me a job when i graduated college.  But I made the most of it and have had an excellent career as a result.  People's experience could vary, but all I can do is testify to my experience and many of thsoe around me.
cons: Again, its hard work and anyone who tells you otherwise is not painting the full picture.  But so much of that is simply the field in which Youth Villages operates.  The time can be demanding and how well you handle it can very greatly based off your personal work style.

I know that the work I am doing is important and helps make the world a better place. Management respects my opinions and gives me opportunities to grow professionally. Based on the policies and practices in the company I can tell that they really do care about their staff.
cons: The work can be challenging some times, but this is mainly because we are developing new products. I wouldn't say it is really a con, but this is definitely not a job that you can simply coast through. The team here sets the bar pretty high and everyone is expected to put the effort in.

[pros: Large endowment - long mine life
Good pay and benefits
cons: Not the worst place that I have ever worked in 44  years in the market, but by far, the most dysfunctional organization I have been involved with.  Barrick/Nevada Gold Mines is/are nothing like what they advertise themselves to be in the recruiting and on-boarding process.  Complete chaos.  All talk and no action.  Management stifles and pushes out producers/innovators in order to protect the legacy positive image they have built for themselves amidst decades of counter productivity and B.S.  Absolutely full of crap.  This company was going bankrupt until they found a company with cash flow to bail them out.  It will only get worse, as the company they let take them over is bringing an African continent mining culture to Northern Nevada that just will not fly on this continent.  Look for continued extreme turnover, and also a mini exodus to occur after yearly bonuses are paid in March (bonuses dramatically decrease in 2020 for many).  Anglo Gold Ashanti tried and failed previously with the negative African mining culture on this continent.  Took them 8-10 years to fail.  Hopefully it won't be as many miserable years for the employees at Barrick/Nevada Gold Mines for them to see Rand and their institutionalized authoritarian hostility fail.  The silver lining is that Newmont is right there to pick out all the gold and good people from the ashes of Barrick's failure.] =",bad,terrible,bad
