<br>
<br> The dataset we use is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidgauthier/glassdoor-job-reviews-2
<br>
## How to use
If only using the recommender:<br>
1. Create a Python 3.8+ environment
2. Install the packages listed in Recommender/requirements.txt
3. Run Recommender/JobApp.py<br><br>

If recreating the project from scratch,<br>
1. Run glassdoor_ratings_clustering.ipynb to perform clustering and process the data
2. Perform steps 1 and 2 of LLM/Readme.md
3. Carry on with using the recommender
